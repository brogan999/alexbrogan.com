Leaders must own everything in their world. There is no one else to blame.‚Äù</p><p id="">‚ÄîJocko Willink </p><p id="">Set clear expectations around what it means to take responsibility. </p><p id="">Elite companies don't finger point or play blame games‚Äîthey own outcomes.</p><h2 id="">Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit&nbsp;</h2><p id="">Don‚Äôt shy away from sharing your point of view or disagreeing.</p><p id="">But, when a decision is made, let go of your ego and commit to the decision. </p><p id="">Popularised by Amazon, this model prevents Groupthink and fosters forward progress.</p><h2 id="">Weekly 1-1's</h2><p id="">1-1‚Äôs are a compulsory weekly meeting between employee and manager. </p><p id="">They can be used for feedback, career development, or to share issues. </p><p id="">Whilst a simple exercise, 1-1‚Äôs are a vital forcing function for continual improvement and monitoring sentiment.</p><p id="">There you have it, 10 of the best frameworks and mental models to foster high-performance.</p><p id="">I hope you found these as helpful as I have.</p><p id="">Stay curious, </p><p id="">Alex</p><p id="">P.S.
