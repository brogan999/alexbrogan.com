It must be the time they're playing."</p><p id="">Always consider common causes and other factors.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Appeal To Emotion</strong></p><p id="">When you use emotion in place of reason in order to win a debate—it's a type of manipulation.</p><p id="">"Don't you care about their feelings in making this decision?"</p><p id="">Appeal to emotion without logic is a fallacy.</p><p id="">However, matched with logic, it's a powerful force.</p><p id=""><strong id="">The Fallacy Fallacy</strong></p><p id="">When you assume that because a fallacy has been made, or a claim has been poorly argued, that the claim itself must be wrong. </p><p id="">It's possible for a claim that is true to be justified with fallacies and weak arguments. </p><p id="">Assess the claim first, then the rest.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Slippery Slope</strong></p><p id="">Claiming that a relatively small first step will lead to a chain of events culminating in a significant event. </p><p id="">This fallacy leverages fear to convince the other party that a course of action should be taken. </p><p id="">Treat the issue at hand, not extreme hypotheticals.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Ad Hominem</strong></p><p id="">Attacking someones character, personal traits, or education in an attempt to undermine their argument. </p><p id="">Person A: Presents compelling, logical case for social welfare</p><p id="">Person B: "Should we believe anything this man has said given he was once arrested in college?"</p><p id=""><strong id="">Burden of Proof</strong></p><p id="">When you avoid your responsbility to provide proof for your reasoning by denying the need to do so, pretending to have done so, or by shifting the responsibility elsewhere. </p><p id="">For example, claiming something is valid purely because no one can 'prove' you wrong.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Loaded Question</strong></p><p id="">Asking a question with a presumption built into it so that it can't be answered without appearing guilty.</p><p id="">The recipient is compelled to defend themselves and is on the back foot. </p><p id="">“Are you naive enough to believe the news, or do you not care about the truth?”</p><p id=""><strong id="">Special Pleading</strong></p><p id="">When you move the goalposts or make up an exception after your claim is shown to be false.</p><p id="">This can involve rationalizing a reason why what you thought to be true must remain to be true after it's shown to be false.</p><p id="">Let go of your old beliefs with integrity.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Personal Incredulity</strong></p><p id="">When you find something difficult to understand, or are unaware of how it works, you exert that it's probably not true.</p><p id="">“I can’t imagine how humans evolved from single-celled organisms; it doesn’t make sense to me. I don't believe the theory of evolution.”</p><p id=""><strong id="">Tu Quoque</strong></p><p id="">When you avoid having to engage with criticism by turning it back on the accuser—you answer criticism with criticism.</p><p id="">Person A: I don't agree with how you acted yesterday. </p><p id="">Person B: I remember when you did something similar 2 years ago. How do you explain that?</p><p id=""><strong id="">The Appeal to Credentials Fallacy</strong></p><p id="">Dismissing advice by stating that whoever gave it doesn’t have proper credentials, so their advice must be wrong or unimportant.</p><p id="">It's problematic because credentials ≠ expertise.</p><p id="">You can pay for credentials but you can't pay for expertise.</p><p id=""><strong id="">The Gamblers Fallacy</strong></p><p id="">When you believe that a random event is more or less likely based on the outcome of a previous event or series of events.</p><p id="">Past events don't change the probability that certain events will occur in the future.</p><p id="">Each event must be considered independently.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Moral Equivalence</strong></p><p id="">Thinking that two things are morally equivalent when they're not.</p><p id="">For example, thinking that racist language and an assault have the same severity.</p><p id="">No. One is an act of violence while the other is words. </p><p id="">Different wrongful conduct has different severity.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Ambiguity</strong></p><p id="">Using a double meaning or ambiguity of language to mislead or misrepresent the truth. </p><p id="">"Sure philosophy helps you argue better, but do we really need to encourage people to argue? There's enough hostility in this world."</p><p id="">Politicians are often guilty of this fallacy.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Red Herring</strong></p><p id="">A deliberate diversion from a relevant or important question. </p><p id="">John: It's morally wrong to lie to your spouse, why on earth did you do that?</p><p id="">Steve: But what is morality exactly?</p><p id="">John: It’s a code of conduct shared by cultures.</p><p id="">Steve: But who creates this code?</p><h1 id="">That's it!
