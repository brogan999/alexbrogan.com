<p id="">Welcome to the <strong id="">417(!!!)</strong> new friends of the Mental Models, Concepts, and Frameworks newsletter who have joined us since last week!</p><h1 id="">Highlights of this newsletter:</h1><ul id=""><li id="">A system for learning intelligently</li><li id="">10 common logical fallacies</li><li id="">10 mental models for making sense of the world</li></ul><h1 id="">A system for learning intelligently</h1><p id="">Learning how to learn is one of life’s most important skills.</p><p id="">Here’s how you can do it intelligently.</p><h2 id="">1/ Learning Selection</h2><p id="">Have you ever started learning something only to stop a few days or weeks later?</p><p id="">This can happen for lots of reasons, but often it's bad learning selection.</p><p id="">Selecting what you learn and when you learn it is crucial to maintaining motivation to finish it.</p><p id="">Here are some questions to make sure you're choosing well:</p><p id="">1/ Is there a need for me to learn this skill/topic? If so, what is it?</p><p id="">2/ How urgent is this need?</p><p id="">3/ Is this the right time to be learning it?</p><p id="">4/ Why will I stick with this project when it gets hard?</p><p id="">5/ Is there a practical use for this learning? Can I use it in my current job?</p><p id="">6/ Would I learn this if no one ever knew that I learnt it?</p><p id="">When we have a clear "why" for learning something, it's easier to remain focused and resilient when it gets difficult.</p><p id="">Choosing a project you'll stick with long enough is an underappreciated factor in learning.</p><p id="">If you switch from project to project, you'll never see the benefit of compounding in any one area.</p><p id="">Focus is key.</p><p id="">Once you've chosen your learning, it's time to deconstruct.</p><h2 id="">2/ Deconstruction</h2><p id="">Every complex skill or topic is just a combination of different skills or topics, just as every hard problem is a combination of smaller problems.</p><p id="">Therefore, one of the smartest ways to learn is to first deconstruct into smaller components.</p><p id=""><strong id="">How to Deconstruct</strong></p><p id="">Step 1: Find the approximate scope of the topic of knowledge / skill</p><p id="">Note down what you need to learn:</p><p id="">- Concepts</p><p id="">- Facts/Key definitions</p><p id="">- Examples or analogies</p><p id="">- Procedures (if it's a skill)</p><p id="">Step 2: Produce a checklist or mindmap of the required learning</p><p id=""><strong id="">Finding the Scope of the Topic</strong></p><p id="">1. Desktop Search:</p><p id="">- Mind maps</p><p id="">- Blog posts</p><p id="">- University curriculum</p><p id="">- Reddit or other online forums</p><p id="">- Table of contents in textbooks</p><p id="">2. Expert Interview:</p><p id="">- Find an expert or someone in your network and ask them what you should be learning</p><h2 id="">3/ Selection/Compression</h2><p id="">Here is where you ask:</p><p id="">1. Which 20% of the blocks (concepts, facts, procedures) should I focus on for 80% or more of the outcome I want?</p><p id="">2. What would I learn if I only had 2 weeks to learn?</p><p id="">Focus on the highest value knowledge first.</p><h2 id="">4/ Sequencing</h2><p id="">Now ask:</p><p id="">1. In what order should I learn the blocks?</p><p id="">2. What is the best logical progression of learning?</p><p id="">3. What are the pre-requisites I need to be able to learn and do before the next step?</p><p id="">Walk before you run.</p><h2 id="">5/ Resources</h2><p id="">In the deconstruct step, you would have found multiple helpful sources that you can use to go deeper.</p><p id="">Now is the time to select which ones you'll use for your learning.</p><p id="">Note down what you'll use:</p><p id="">- Books</p><p id="">- Videos</p><p id="">- Podcasts</p><p id="">- Courses</p><p id="">- Coaches, etc.</p><p id="">Bonus tip: if you know your learning style, you should preference using resources that align with that learning style.</p><p id="">Learning styles (VARK Model): Visual, Auditory, Read/Write, Kinaesthetic.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640fae0a6084e344db40c11e_FQeqQoLWQAgoLF0.jpeg" id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2 id="">6/ Schedule</h2><p id="">Here's where you make it concrete and ask:</p><p id="">1. When do I want to complete this learning project?</p><p id="">2. How many hours will I commit per week?</p><p id="">3. When am I committing these hours?</p><p id="">Place the details in your calendar, set reminders, and make it easy for yourself.</p><h2 id="">7/ Stakes/Incentives</h2><p id="">Here's where you failure proof your commitment to learning.</p><p id="">Ask:</p><p id="">1. How can I set up real consequences to guarantee that I follow my learning project?</p><p id="">2. How can I failure proof my decision?</p><p id="">A goal without real consequences is wishful thinking.</p><p id="">Now it's time to execute.</p><p id="">I've previously covered 13 powerful learning techniques for the actual learning component.</p><p id="">You can dive in here:</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center" style="padding-bottom:33.75%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="33.75%" data-rt-dimensions="0:0" data-page-url=""><div><iframe scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?dnt=false&embedId=twitter-widget-0&features=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%3D&frame=false&hideCard=false&hideThread=false&id=1512830220906151942&lang=en&origin=https%3A%2F%2Falexbrogan.beehiiv.com%2Fp%2Fa-system-for-learning-intelligently-10-common-logical-fallacies-and-10-mental-models-for-making-sens&sessionId=6ea6b5654f2c6402dd362796c46eba37df567d3c&theme=light&widgetsVersion=aaf4084522e3a%3A1674595607486&width=550px"></iframe></div></figure><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center" style="padding-bottom:33.75%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="33.75%" data-rt-dimensions="0:0" data-page-url=""><div><iframe scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?dnt=false&embedId=twitter-widget-1&features=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%3D&frame=false&hideCard=false&hideThread=false&id=1509206345697927170&lang=en&origin=https%3A%2F%2Falexbrogan.beehiiv.com%2Fp%2Fa-system-for-learning-intelligently-10-common-logical-fallacies-and-10-mental-models-for-making-sens&sessionId=6ea6b5654f2c6402dd362796c46eba37df567d3c&theme=light&widgetsVersion=aaf4084522e3a%3A1674595607486&width=550px"></iframe></div></figure><p id="">For more on learning intelligently, these are the best resources I've found:</p><p id=""><em id="">The First 20 Hours: How to Learn Anything...Fast -Josh Kaufman</em></p><p id=""><em id="">The 4-Hour Chef - Tim Ferriss</em></p><p id=""><em id="">Ultralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career - Scott Young</em></p><h1 id="">10 common logical fallacies</h1><h2 id="">Anecdotal (vs. Empirical Evidence)</h2><p id="">Using a personal experience or an isolated example to try and prove a point instead of empirical or more compelling evidence.</p><p id="">Humans tend to believe and relate to stories, but don't fall into this trap.</p><p id="">What's true for you isn't always true.</p><h2 id="">Begging The Question</h2><p id="">Involves presenting a circular argument where the conclusion is included in the premise.</p><p id="">Examples:</p><p id="">1/ "Of course smoking causes cancer.
