<p id="">Welcome to the new friends of the A Players newsletter who have joined us since last week!</p><h1 id="">This Week: How to be more effective in 2023? These will help </h1><h2 id="">Decomplication</h2><p id="">We’ve been led to believe that our everyday problems—weight loss, productivity, saving money—require complex solutions. </p><p id="">This is called ‘artificial complexity.’</p><p id="">Decomplication is the process of boiling problems down to their simplest form. </p><p id="">h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/nateliason" target="_blank" id="">@nateliason</a></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640d564a3d2f142b2481230b_image.jpeg" id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2 id="">Via Negativa</h2><p id="">When we have a problem, our natural instinct is to add a new habit or buy a solution.</p><p id="">But usually, you improve your life by subtracting instead.</p><p id="">The foods you avoid are more important than the foods you eat.</p><p id="">Subtracting distractions is the key to productivity.</p><h2 id="">Speed Matters</h2><p id="">The faster you do things, the less activation energy is required to do any one thing. </p><p id="">To avoid procrastination, keep the activation energy low by shortening the timeframe for the work that needs to be done, and work faster. </p><p id="">h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/jsomers" target="_blank" id="">@jsomers</a></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640d564a3d2f14b3c2812308_image.jpeg" id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2 id="">Hourly Aspirational Rate</h2><p id="">Figure out how much an hour of your time is worth: Your 'aspirational hourly' rate.</p><p id="">When deciding whether or not to do a task, ask whether it's worth more or less than your rate.</p><p id="">If it's worth less than your rate, outsource, automate, or delete it.</p><h2 id="">Trust in Calendar</h2><p id="">”A calendar speaks more truth than a to-do list.</p><p id="">Your to-do list is the ideal Sunday evening theory. </p><p id="">Your calendar is the brutal Monday to Friday practice.</p><p id="">Operate accordingly: you must block time in your calendar for deep work.”</p><p id="">h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/shreyas" target="_blank" id="">@shreyas</a></p><h2 id="">High-Leverage Activities </h2><p id="">To maximize output, spend time on the activities that will influence that output the most.</p><p id="">The more you need to do an activity or the more you are affected by it, the higher the leverage is on time spent perfecting that thing. </p><p id="">h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/rabois" target="_blank" id="">@rabois</a></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640d564a3d2f1409d1812309_image.jpeg" id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2 id="">The Top Idea In Your Mind</h2><p id="">The topic you think about in the shower is “The Top Idea In Your Mind.”</p><p id="">If it's not what you want to be thinking about, it might indicate your focus isn’t where it should be: on your most important problem.</p><p id="">If so, you may need to change something.</p><h2 id="">The Productivity Frontier</h2><p id="">Up to a point—the productivity frontier—productivity is about optimizing the way you work.</p><p id="">When you reach the frontier, higher achievement results from making hard trade-offs about what you work on.</p><p id="">Focus and single-tasking are key. </p><p id="">h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottHYoung" target="_blank" id="">@ScottHYoung</a></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640d564a3d2f146759812307_image.jpeg" id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2 id="">Flow States</h2><p id="">Flow is a heightened state of concentration where time passes without notice and you feel a deep sense of fulfillment in your work.</p><p id="">How to get there?</p><p id="">• Use deadlines</p><p id="">• Do tasks you enjoy</p><p id="">• Eliminate distractions</p><p id="">• Choose tasks that challenge you</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640d564a3d2f140890812305_image.jpeg" id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2 id="">Write Before Action</h2><p id="">Write down what you plan to do and how you plan to do it (in detail) before you do it. </p><p id="">How does this help?

If you allocate 10 days, it will take 10 days.</p><p id="">Remember: The sooner you finish, the sooner you can move on.</p><p id="">Advice: Use artificial deadlines.</p><h2 id="">Pomodoro Technique</h2><p id="">Use a timer to break down work into intervals of ~25-45mins separated by short breaks—the intervals are called Pomodoro’s.</p><p id="">This model taps into Parkinson’s law and causes you to try and get more done within each short time period, with a reward at the end.</p><h2 id="">Gate's Law</h2><p id="">We overestimate what we can do in one year and underestimate what we can do in ten years.</p><p id="">Humans think in linear terms, so we struggle to contemplate the compounding returns on actions over a decade.</p><p id="">Don’t be dispirited if 1-year isn’t enough to hit your goals.</p><h2 id="">Maker's vs Manager's Schedule</h2><p id="">There are two types of schedules.</p><p id="">Manager: The work you do changes every hour.</p><p id="">Maker: The work you do requires long, uninterrupted units of time—e.g., programmers.</p><p id="">Figure out the schedule your role requires to do your best work and stick to it.</p><h2 id="">Effectiveness vs. Efficiency</h2><p id="">Effectiveness: Doing the right things—getting the result you intend.</p><p id="">Efficiency: Doing things right—working with minimal waste of time and effort.</p><p id="">To achieve more, you must be both effective &amp; efficient, but effectiveness should come first.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640d564a3d2f14cb6a812303_image.jpeg" id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2 id="">Discipline Equals Freedom</h2><p id="">”Discipline and Freedom seem like they sit on opposite ends of the spectrum, but they are actually very connected. </p><p id="">Freedom is what everyone wants.</p><p id="">But the only way to get to a place of freedom is through discipline.”</p><p id="">h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/jockowillink" target="_blank" id="">@jockowillink</a></p><h2 id="">Systems vs. Goals</h2><p id="">To achieve more, focus on the process first—the system—that will get you to the goal.</p><p id="">Doing something every day is a system—like writing for 1 hour.</p><p id="">Writing a book is a goal.</p><p id="">"Goals determine your direction.
