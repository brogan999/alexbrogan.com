<p id="">Welcome to the <strong id="">500(!)</strong> new friends of the Mental Models, Concepts, and Frameworks newsletter who have joined us since last week!</p><h1 id="">This week: The Jeff Bezos Reversible vs. Irreversible Decisions Framework</h1><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img alt="Jeff Bezos" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640fac575f2ea5259788a4ca_FR7W2mhXIAoRDfY.jpeg" id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p id="">The Jeff Bezos Reversible vs. Irreversible Decisions Framework is a powerful mental model for unlocking growth in your career, business, relationships, or life.</p><p id="">In this newsletter, we'll cover what it is and how you can use it to improve your life.</p><p id="">Let's dive in!</p><p id="">Jeffrey Bezos is the founder and former CEO of Amazon.</p><p id="">With a net worth of US$182b, he's the world's second wealthiest person.</p><p id="">Capitalism rewards innovation, and Bezos has arguably conquered the game of capitalism.</p><p id="">While a master innovator today, this wasn't always the case.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640fac57c6db4f386ca4b922_FR7W3NTXwAMfH-4.jpeg" id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p id="">Amazon's defining trait is its ability to stay nimble, creating countless innovative products while achieving enviable scale.</p><p id="">Some notable products include:</p><ul id=""><li id="">Go</li><li id="">Prime</li><li id="">Alexa</li><li id="">Kindle</li><li id="">Web Services</li><li id="">One-click checkout</li></ul><p id="">These didn't happen by accident.</p><p id="">In a now famous letter to shareholders, Bezos explained how a company as large as Amazon can continue to be an invention machine:</p><p id="">"By avoiding 'one-size-fits-all' decision-making."</p><p id=""><strong id=""><em id="">"We want to be a large company that’s also an invention machine. </em></strong><em id="">We want to combine the extraordinary customer-serving capabilities that are enabled by size with the speed of movement, nimbleness, and risk-acceptance mentality normally associated with entrepreneurial start-ups.<br><br></em><strong id=""><em id="">Can we do it? I’m optimistic.</em></strong><em id=""> We have a good start on it, and I think our culture puts us in a position to achieve the goal. But I don’t think it’ll be easy. There are some subtle traps that even high-performing large organizations can fall into as a matter of course, and we’ll have to learn as an institution how to guard against them. </em><strong id=""><em id="">One common pitfall for large organizations – one that hurts speed and inventiveness – is “one-size-fits-all” decision making."</em></strong></p><p id="">Jeff Bezos</p><p id="">Enter: 'Reversible' and 'Irreversible' decisions.</p><p id="">We often think that collecting more information will help us make better decisions.</p><p id="">Sometimes that's true, but most of the time it prevents forward progress.</p><p id="">Other times it can be the difference between success or failure.</p><p id="">To avoid this trap, Bezos asks himself, "Is this a reversible or irreversible decision?"</p><p id="">Irreversible decisions are 'one-way doors.'</p><p id="">If you walk through them and don't like what you see, you can't get back to where you were before.</p><p id="">They must be made slowly and deliberately.</p><p id=""><strong id=""><em id="">"Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible</em></strong><em id=""> – one-way doors – and </em><strong id=""><em id="">these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation.</em></strong><em id=""> If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before.
