<p id=""><strong id="">Brand names (Stripe, Anthropic, Goldman Sachs, McKinsey) are optional, but they do imply positive traits that people will take you seriously for.</strong> If you don’t get a brand name, you can still imply your capabilities in a permissionless way through the internet. Create content. Create apps. Build things people want. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/noahkagan_a-few-months-ago-a-high-schooler-sent-me-activity-7195134321655955456-xsdX/" id="">Apprentice under someone impressive</a> by sending them a cold email.</p><p>‍</p><p id=""><strong id="">Work insanely hard in your 20’s.</strong> Weekends are a social construct popularised by Henry Ford in the early 20th century to encourage people to travel more (so they would use his cars).

Middle age is when men (note: we need this data for females, too!) tend to do their best work. For example, across disciplines, <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Career-landmarks-in-science%3A-Individual-differences-Simonton/95f59474053184a900c0fbc5d255129ac9e33839?p2df" id="">a clear pattern emerges</a> for achievement among scientists.

Here's a visual from one of my favourite podcasts, Art Of Investing, hosted by Rick Buhrman and Paul Buser:</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/67428d1a2e411d04a0b28212_67428c2a0b709b60e001a639_CleanShot%25202024-11-24%2520at%252013.11.20.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">The whole premise is to find your "P", improve your "R", and nurture your "T"</p><p>‍</p><p id="">P = Principal = Passion/Purpose/The thing you choose to work on</p><p>‍</p><p id="">R = Growth Rate = How quickly you can compound. </p><p>‍</p><p id="">In the career sense, I think the critical factors (let’s call these, ‘career force multipliers’) that determine growth rate are:</p><p>‍</p><p id=""><strong id="">Career force multipliers:</strong><br></p><p id=""><strong id="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)</strong>&nbsp;Status/credibility/brand.</p><p id=""><strong id="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;</strong>Personal relationships.</p><p id=""><strong id="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;</strong>Skills. These can be:</p><ul id=""><li id="">Domain-specific—e.g., machine learning, general-business—e.g., marketing, sales, finance, or,</li><li id="">Meta-—such as how fast you can learn, decision-making, effective communication, writing, etc.</li></ul><p id=""><strong id="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) </strong>Knowledge.</p><p id=""><strong id="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)</strong>&nbsp;Beliefs.</p><p id=""><strong id="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)</strong>&nbsp;Traits (E.g., Confidence, Tenacity, Discipline). <br></p><p>‍</p><p id="">T = Time period</p><p>‍</p><p id="">What's critical to appreciate is that whenever you change career direction, you're fiercely interrupting compounding. You're not only changing "P," you're also reducing "R" and, of course ", T" on whatever it is you're switching to.</p><p>‍</p><p id="">Hence, the range vs. specialist conversation is mostly people talking past each other. Range is essential when you're young in helping cultivate broad interests, skills, and knowledge, etc. However, to maximise the growth rate and compounding in the long-term, specialising is essential.<strong id="">‍</strong></p><p>‍</p><p id=""><strong id="">Question mimetic desire.</strong> Mimetic desire is our tendency to inherit desires from other people—such as family or celebrities. Simply put, we want what other people want. To find your ideal career, start with honestly asking yourself whether your current role was a mimetic choice.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/67428d1a2e411d04a0b2821c_67428d036c8805d6825cee2b_Mimetic%2520Desire.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id=""><strong id="">Inversion.</strong> Next, ask, “<a href="https://mindfulambition.net/vision-setting-debbie-millman-remarkable-life-exercise/">what do I want my career/life to look like in 20 years?</a>” When you determine what you want in the end, it's easier to see the set of possibilities that can get you there. Ask what you value most. Ask what careers will enable that.<br></p><p>‍</p><p id=""><strong id="">Use everything you have. </strong>Everyone has different advantages in life, not using them is a failure mode. People also start at different times. Sometimes they start on third base, but you don’t know that from the outside. “Comparison is the thief of joy” is often misinterpreted. Comparison shows you what’s possible, but don’t feel behind. 99 times out of 100, the most likely explanation is that someone started before you or had advantages you can’t see from the outside. Only compare yourself to your starting point. If your Auntie owns a great business, work there. If you have access to leading scientists, ask them questions. If you can raise capital, raise it.</p><p>‍</p><p id=""><strong id="">Think of your career like a video game maze. </strong>You enter a pitch black room and know nothing about the territory. You have to explore it to light up areas of the territory and actually understand what lies behind each turn. These are like opportunities in your career. There is no substitute for direct exeprience with something. <a href="https://x.com/_alexbrogan/status/1737839371964039565" id="">Explore and then exploit</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p id=""><strong id="">Local vs. Global Maxima.</strong> Once you’ve explored, what to exploit? Find your global maximum and take the path that leads there—even if it means taking a backward step. This is the path that you’re excited to get out of bed for in the morning—something that feels like play.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/67428d1a2e411d04a0b2820d_67428cf204ee4fea387c2f5f_Global%2520and%2520Local%2520Maxima.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id=""><strong id="">Finding what you love to do is not just a cliche.</strong> <a href="https://www.alexbrogan.com/essays/if-youre-not-curious-youll-never-be-great">If you’re not curious, you’ll never be great</a>.

Tim Ferriss put this best:</p><p id=""><em id="">“If you are insecure, guess what? The rest of the world is, too. Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself. You are better than you think. The fishing is best where the fewest go, and the collective insecurity of the world makes it easy for people to hit home runs while everyone else is aiming for base hits. There is just less competition for bigger goals.”</em></p><p>‍</p><p id=""><strong id="">Remember </strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_effect" id=""><strong id="">the spotlight effect</strong></a><strong id="">.</strong> No one is thinking about you as much as you think they are. Even if they are, you’re going to die one day and none of it matters. Do not allow yourself to succumb to the expectations of others or societal norms.

For every piece of advice there is equal and opposite advice. Trust in your ability to absorb knowledge, reflect, and learn. There are no prescriptions.
