<p id="">Welcome to the <strong id="">300(!)</strong> new friends of the Mental Models, Concepts, and Frameworks newsletter who have joined us since last week!</p><h1 id="">This Week: 11 of the most powerful frameworks and principles for productivity</h1><h2 id="">Deep Work</h2><p id="">Deep work is single-tasking, limiting your context switching and distractions in your immediate working environment.</p><p id="">Shallow work is logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted.</p><p id="">h/t Cal Newport</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640fa9777975fd2170e853c0_image.jpeg" id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2 id="">Hofstadter's Law</h2><p id="">Projects always take longer than expected, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.</p><p id="">You're generally bad at estimating when things will get done.</p><p id="">The deeper point: We often have a choice of when to call a project “done.”</p><p id="">Use this choice more often.</p><h2 id="">Elon's Law</h2><p id="">If you have a project, combat Hofstader's Law by setting a ridiculously ambitious deadline.</p><p id="">Even if you fail to meet it, you're still ahead.</p><p id="">Isn’t it better to miss an aggressive deadline than a conservative one?</p><p id="">It's no wonder Musk has achieved so much.</p><h2 id="">Murphy's Law</h2><p id="">”Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.”</p><p id="">This is another reason to use Elon’s Law.</p><p id="">When planning long-term projects, consider a margin of safety to ensure you can handle any interruptions to planned progress and still meet your deadline easily.</p><h2 id="">Parkinson's Law</h2><p id="">Work expands to fill the time allotted to it.</p><p id="">If you allocate 4 weeks, it will take 4 weeks. If you allocate 10 days, it will take 10 days.</p><p id="">Remember: The sooner you finish, the sooner you can move on.</p><p id="">Advice: Use artificial deadlines.</p><h2 id="">Pomodoro Technique</h2><p id="">Use a timer to break down work into intervals of ~25-45mins separated by short breaks—the intervals are called Pomodoro’s.</p><p id="">This model taps into Parkinson’s law and causes you to try and get more done within each short time period, with a reward at the end.</p><h2 id="">Gate's Law</h2><p id="">We overestimate what we can do in one year and underestimate what we can do in ten years.</p><p id="">Humans think in linear terms, so we struggle to contemplate the compounding returns on actions over a decade.</p><p id="">Don’t be dispirited if 1-year isn’t enough to hit your goals.</p><h2 id="">Maker's vs Manager's Schedule</h2><p id="">There are two types of schedules.</p><p id="">Manager: The work you do changes every hour.</p><p id="">Maker: The work you do requires long, uninterrupted units of time—e.g., programmers.</p><p id="">Figure out the schedule your role requires to do your best work and stick to it.</p><h2 id="">Effectiveness vs. Efficiency</h2><p id="">Effectiveness: Doing the right things—getting the result you intend.</p><p id="">Efficiency: Doing things right—working with minimal waste of time and effort.</p><p id="">To achieve more, you must be both effective &amp; efficient, but effectiveness should come first.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640fa9775ee0d9c47a5a016a_image.png" id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2 id="">Discipline Equals Freedom</h2><p id="">”Discipline and Freedom seem like they sit on opposite ends of the spectrum, but they are actually very connected.</p><p id="">Freedom is what everyone wants.</p><p id="">But the only way to get to a place of freedom is through discipline.”</p><p id="">h/t <a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3R3aXR0ZXIuY29tL2pvY2tvd2lsbGluayIsInBvc3RfaWQiOiJhNGM0YzhkOS1mNTc3LTQyNTgtODFlMy02NDRhNGRkZDY3MGYiLCJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbl9pZCI6IjEzN2Q1ZTgzLTk1MDMtNGRiNy1hOGM0LWYzNDE1YzIwNTVhZSIsInZpc2l0X3Rva2VuIjoiN2NiN2I3ZTUtOTEyNS00NDJmLWI4YjgtMjdjZGMxNTJhZGJiIiwiaWF0IjoxNjc4NzA1NTkwLjA2OCwiaXNzIjoib3JjaGlkIn0.Qgv5OvgFv5rRkIN9grvRF6TM-deKDY_YmyyITNDbubg" target="_blank" id="">@jockowillink</a></p><h2 id="">Systems vs. Goals</h2><p id="">Systems vs. Goals</p><p id="">To achieve more, focus on the process first—the system—that will get you to the goal.</p><p id="">Doing something every day is a system—like writing for 1 hour.</p><p id="">Writing a book is a goal.</p><p id="">"Goals determine your direction.
