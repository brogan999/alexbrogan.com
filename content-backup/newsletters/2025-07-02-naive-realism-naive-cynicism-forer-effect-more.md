And how would I feel if I faced, and heartily embraced, the truth?”</p><p id=""><strong id="">Narrative Fallacy</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to interpret sequences of facts as a story by threading them together into an imagined chain of cause &amp; effect</p><p id="">If an alcoholic loses their job we assume the alcoholism led to it, even if it didn’t</p><p id=""><strong id="">Curiosity Instinct</strong></p><p id="">We like to call other species curious, but we are the most curious of all</p><p id="">Without the human curiosity instinct, science and technology would not be present</p><p id="">Even before there were direct incentives to innovate (capitalism), humans innovated out of curiosity</p><p id=""><strong id="">Language Instinct</strong></p><p id="">Humans are born with an innate capacity for language</p><p id="">Language is an ability unique to humans, produced by evolution to solve the specific problem of communication among social hunter-gatherers</p><p id="">Good communication is a superpower</p><p id=""><strong id="">First-conclusion bias</strong></p><p id="">A tendency to settle on the first information or conclusion adopted for a given problem, thus remaining resistant to the search for any more alternatives or asking further questions</p><p id="">Can be countered with simple useful mental routines (objective reasoning)</p><p id=""><strong id="">Relative satisfaction/misery tendencies</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to determine one’s own level of satisfaction by comparing circumstances to others’ circumstances</p><p id="">These relative tendencies cause us great misery or happiness in a very wide variety of objectively different situations</p><p id=""><strong id="">Hyperbolic Discounting</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to show a preference for immediate rather than delayed rewards</p><p id="">Humans discount future events. This is why it's easy to succumb to bad habits</p><p id="">Bad habits have an immediate payoff while the benefits of good habits can take years to see</p><p id=""><strong id="">Illusion of control</strong></p><p id="">The tendency for people to overestimate their ability to control events</p><p id="">This leads us to overestimate our odds of succeeding or getting a positive outcome and to invent explanations linking our behavior to some result</p><p id=""><strong id="">Loss aversion</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to prefer avoiding losses compared to acquiring equivalent gains</p><p id="">This overwhelming fear of loss can you to behave irrationally and make bad decisions, such as holding onto a stock for too long or too little time</p><p id=""><strong id="">Maslow's Heirarchy of needs</strong></p><p id="">The motivational theory created by psychologist Abraham Maslow stating that humans have five categories of needs in order: physiological, safety, love, esteem, and self-actualization</p><p id="">At the bottom of the pyramid are the physiological (or basic) human needs that are required for survival: food, shelter, water, sleep, etc.</p><p id="">If these requirements are not met, the body cannot continue to function</p><p id="">Once physical needs are satisfied, security (aka individual safety) takes precedence</p><p id="">Security and safety needs include personal security, financial security, and health and well-being</p><p id="">These first two levels are critical to our physical survival</p><p id="">Once we have basic nutrition, shelter, and safety, we seek to fulfill higher-level needs</p><p id="">The third level of need is social, which include love and belonging; the need to share and connect with others</p><p id="">Deficiencies at this level can impact our ability to form and maintain emotionally significant relationships</p><p id="">We (humans) need to feel a sense of belonging and acceptance</p><p id="">Without this feeling, it's easy to succumb to psychological difficulties such as loneliness or depression</p><p id="">The fourth level is esteem, which represents our innate desire to be valued and validated by others (through recognition or success)</p><p id="">This level also includes self-esteem, which refers to the regard and acceptance we have four ourselves</p><p id="">Imbalances at this level can result in low self-esteem or an inferiority complex</p><p id="">When we suffer from low self-esteem we may find that external validation by others—through fame, glory, accolades, etc.—only partially or temporarily fulfills needs at this level</p><p id="">The fifth level of the pyramid is self-actualization</p><p id="">Here we feel that we've reached our full potential and are doing everything we're capable of</p><p id="">Self-actualization is rarely a permanent feeling or state</p><p id="">Rather, it refers to the ongoing need for personal growth and discovery that we have throughout their lives</p><p id="">Self-actualization may occur after reaching an important goal or overcoming a particular challenge, and it may be marked by a new sense of self-confidence or contentment</p><p id="">So, what does this tell us? Higher needs in the hierarchy emerge when the previous need is appropriately satisfied</p><p id="">We must endeavour to meet our lower level needs—what I like to call the foundation—before we can become the best version of ourselves</p><p id=""><strong id="">Operant Conditioning</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to make associations between a behaviour and consequence (whether negative or positive) for that behaviour</p><p id="">Helps inform the optimal approach to learning in a given environment (e.g., the carrot or the stick approach)1</p><p id=""><strong id="">Tribalism</strong></p><p id="">A way of thinking in which people are overly loyal to their own social group, at times disregarding logic and devaluing kindness or justice</p><p id="">Vaccination vs. Anti-Vaccination.

Wanting what others have for yourself</p><p id="">Pride: A need for public acceptance in all acts or a need to be more important than others</p><p id=""><strong id="">Self-Interest (aka "What's in it for me")</strong></p><p id="">The tendency for the brain to subconsciously decide that what's good for it is good for everyone else</p><p id="">Those who preference the best outcome rather than being right are people you want to work with</p><p id=""><strong id="">Squelch By Denial</strong></p><p id="">Related to self-interest. The tendency to silence anything that interferes with our own personal success or income</p><p id="">Again, strive to work with people who want the optimal outcome for most, not just them</p><p id=""><strong id="">Foot in the Door Technique</strong></p><p id="">A compliance tactic that assumes agreeing to a small request increases the likelihood of agreeing to a second, larger request</p><p id="">Example: Offering to work for free as a means of securing a full-time job at the firm you'd like to work at</p><p id=""><strong id="">Most Respectful Interpretation</strong></p><p id="">Assuming the best of others. Considering only the best, kindest, most helpful interpretation of every communication and responding solely to that version</p><p id="">Involves resisting jumping to negative conclusions and preferencing generous ones</p><p id=""><strong id="">Bright spots</strong></p><p id="">A bright spot is a positive sign in a sea of negative ones</p><p id="">Asking if there are bright spots can help inform whether it's worth persevering with a particular endeavour</p><p id="">E.g, in business, a bright spot may be a small subset of customers who love what you're doing</p><p id="">In your career, it may be the things you love about your job</p><p id="">Asking whether there are enough bright spots to warrant persisting is a good strategy</p><p id="">If you can’t find any bright spots in what you’re doing after some time, critically evaluate your position and consider a pivot</p><p id=""><strong id="">Burnout</strong></p><p id="">Where continued high stress takes its toll and eventually extinguishes your motivation, sometimes requiring a complete reset</p><p id="">Life is a marathon, you'll achieve more over your career by being consistently productive and compounding success</p><p id="">At times, it makes sense to sprint and then rest, but for most people, it's important to find a level of productivity that can be sustained over the course of a career</p><p id="">Antidote: Listen closely to your body and mind</p><p id="">See Four Thousand Weeks by @oliverburkeman for more on this</p><p id=""><strong id="">Decision Fatigue</strong></p><p id="">Making decisions is exhausting. Anyone who has ever researched a long trip—flight, hotels, activities, restaurants, weather—knows this well</p><p id="">After all the comparing, considering, and choosing, you are exhausted. Science calls this decision fatigue</p><p id="">Decision fatigue is dangerous: As a consumer, you become more susceptible to advertising messages and impulse buys</p><p id="">As a decision maker, you are more prone to seduction or persuasion</p><p id="">Willpower is like a battery. After a while it runs out and needs to be recharged</p><p id="">How do you do this? By taking a break, relaxing, and eating something</p><p id="">What does it tell us? Save your important decisions for the morning and minimise the number of menial decisions you make each day (remember why Steve jobs wore the same clothes every day...?)</p><p id=""><strong id="">Default Effect (Status)</strong></p><p id="">People crave what they know. Given the choice of trying something new or sticking to the tried-and-tested option, we tend to be highly conservative, even if a change would be beneficial</p><p id="">Where does it come from? Sheer convenience and loss aversion</p><p id=""><strong id="">Gateway drug theory</strong></p><p id="">The tendency for a drug to lead to an increased probability of the use of further dangerous substances</p><p id="">Proponents suggest that the adverse effects of these substances are minimal, but they should be avoided because they lead to more harmful drug use</p><p id=""><strong id="">Golem Effect</strong></p><p id="">Related to the observer effect, the tendency for performance to decline when supervisors, teachers, or bosses have low expectations of one’s abilities</p><p id="">The golem effect is a type of self-fulfilling prophecy</p><p id=""><strong id="">Intuition</strong></p><p id="">You make most of your everyday decisions using your intuition, with your subconscious automatically intuiting what to do from encoded knowledge</p><p id="">It’s your sixth sense, your gut feeling, drawing on your past experiences and natural programming to react to circumstances</p><p id="">You can run into trouble when you blindly trust your gut in situations where it is unclear whether you should be thinking more deliberately</p><p id="">Following your intuition alone can cause you to fall prey to many biases, such as anchoring or the availability bias</p><p id="">You probably don't have the right experience intuitively to handle everything that life throws at you, and so you should be especially wary of your intuition in any new or unfamiliar situation</p><p id="">In these situations, slow down and bring objective decision-making to the table</p><p id=""><strong id="">Learned helplessness</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to stop trying to escape difficult situations because we have gotten used to these conditions over time</p><p id="">Someone learns that they are helpless to control their circumstances, so they give up trying to change them</p><p id="">Learned helplessness can be overcome when we see that our actions make a difference, that we aren’t actually helpless</p><p id="">If feeling helpless, focus on the small wins and progression, or seek feedback from someone who can lift you up</p><p id=""><strong id="">Non-response bias</strong></p><p id="">Occurs when a subset of people don't participate in an experiment after they're selected for it (they fail to respond to the survey)</p><p id="">If the reason for not responding is related to the topic of the survey, the results will end up biased</p><p id="">For example, your company wants to understand whether it has a problem with employee motivation</p><p id="">You choose to study it via an engagement survey</p><p id="">Employees missing the survey due to vacation would be random and not likely to introduce bias</p><p id="">However, employees not responding due to apathy would be nonrandom and would likely bias the results</p><p id="">That's because the latter group is made up of disengaged employees, and by not participating, their disengagement is not being captured</p><p id=""><strong id="">Observer Expectancy Bias</strong></p><p id="">Where the cognitive biases of researchers, or observers, may cause them to influence the outcome in the direction they expected</p><p id=""><strong id="">Optimistic Probability Bias</strong></p><p id="">Sometimes you may want something to be true so badly that you fool yourself into thinking it is likely to be true—this is known as optimistic probability bias</p><p id="">The closer you are to the facts, the easier it is to avoid this bias</p><p id=""><strong id="">Paranoia</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to believe that others are trying to harm, deceive or exploit you</p><p id="">Some level of paranoia is helpful but too much will shut you off from the world—it's good to be sceptical, but not too sceptical</p><p id=""><strong id="">Present Bias</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to overvalue near-term rewards over making incremental progress on long-term goals</p><p id="">This explains a lot of procrastination.
