target="_blank" id="">written 200+ essays</a> since 1993 that are a gold mine of wisdom on wealth creation, living a fulfilling life, and beating the status quo.</p><p id="">Here are 16 of the very best mental models from his essays.</p><h2 id="">Be Good</h2><p id="">Being good is a competitive advantage.</p><p id="">It sets the compass for difficult decisions, allowing accelerated progress.</p><p id="">It makes other people want to help you on your mission.</p><p id="">It gets you through the inevitable ups-and-downs because you're anchored to purpose.</p><h2 id="">How to Think for Yourself</h2><p id="">Thinking for yourself is life’s greatest competitive advantage—you see opportunities others don’t.</p><ul id=""><li id="">Read History</li><li id="">Ask, “Is it true?”</li><li id="">Meet different types of people</li><li id="">Be less aware of conventional beliefs</li><li id="">Cultivate independent-minded friends</li></ul><h2 id="">How to Cultivate Curiosity</h2><p id="">Avoid situations that suppress it—stagnant work environments and close-minded people.</p><p id="">Seek novel environments and situations—travel or communities.</p><p id="">Seek out topics that engage it.</p><p id="">Indulge it, by investigating things you're interested in.</p><h2 id="">The Conformist Test</h2><p id="">”Do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to share with your peers?</p><p id="">If the answer is no, you might want to stop and think about that.</p><p id="">If everything you believe is something you're supposed to believe, odds are you think what you're told.”</p><h2 id="">How to Work Hard</h2><p id="">If you want to do great things, you’ll have to work extremely hard.</p><p id="">Deep interest in a topic makes you work harder than any amount of discipline can.</p><p id="">Be honest with yourself to know when you’re being lazy or working too hard—find your limit.</p><h2 id="">Keep Your Identity Small</h2><p id="">We struggle to think objectively about things that become part of our identity.</p><p id="">The more labels we give ourselves, the more emotionally we respond.</p><p id="">The best plan is to let as few things into your identity as possible.</p><p id="">Be nimble and hard to define.</p><h2 id="">How To Get Rich</h2><p id="">”To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things, measurement and leverage.</p><p id="">You need to be in a position where your performance can be measured.</p><p id="">And you have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have a big effect.”</p><h2 id="">Good and Bad Procrastination</h2><p id="">Good procrastination is avoiding work that has 0 chance of being mentioned in your obituary—like errands.</p><p id="">”Unless you're working on the biggest things you could be working on, you're type-B procrastinating, no matter how much you're getting done.”</p><h2 id="">The Top Idea In Your Mind</h2><p id="">The topic you think about in the shower is “The Top Idea In Your Mind.”</p><p id="">If it's not what you want to be thinking about, it might indicate you’re dealing with unwanted problems subconsciously.</p><p id="">If so, you may need to change something.</p><h2 id="">Mean People Fail</h2><p id="">For most of history, success meant success at zero-sum games—meanness was a competitive advantage.</p><p id="">Increasingly, the world is made of positive-sum games.</p><p id="">You win not by fighting for control, but by having novel ideas and improving the lives of others.</p><h2 id="">Managers Schedule vs. Makers Schedule</h2><p id="">There are two types of schedule.</p><p id="">Manager: The work you do changes every hour.</p><p id="">Those on a manager’s schedule should understand the cost of interruptions for makers.</p><h2 id="">Relentlessly Resourceful</h2><p id="">To win in the startup world, "making something people want" is the destination, but "being relentlessly resourceful" is how you get there.</p><p id="">Being relentless is not enough.</p><p id="">The challenges of startups are novel and require novel thinking—resourcefulness.</p><h2 id="">How to Disagree Well</h2><p id="">”If you have something real to say, being mean gets in the way.</p><p id="">The greatest benefit of disagreeing well is not just that it will make conversations better, but that it will make the people who have them happier.”</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img

id="">There are great startup ideas lying unexploited right under our noses, but they seem too hard for most.</p><p id="">So instead, people tend towards easier, less important ideas.</p><p id="">Don’t shrink from ‘dirty’ work if it’s on the path to something great.</p><p id="">h/t - <a

Don’t Scale</h2><p id="">Universally, startups require unscalable efforts to kickstart their growth.</p><p id="">For example, recruiting users manually or constraining the product to a narrow market.</p><p id="">Dismissing the need to do “unscalable” things is one of the surest ways to failure.</p><h2 id="">The Economics of Working in Startups</h2><p id="">"Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole working life into a few years.</p><p id="">Instead of working at a low intensity for forty years, you work as hard as you possibly can for four.
