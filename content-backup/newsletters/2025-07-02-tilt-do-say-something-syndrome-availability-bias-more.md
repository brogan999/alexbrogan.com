Decision journals and honest self-assessment</p><p id=""><strong id="">Mere exposure effect:</strong> The tendency to develop a preference for things merely because we're familiar with them</p><p id="">Critical in decision-making; when deciding between alternatives, we shouldn't choose the familiar option, we should choose the best option based on its effectiveness</p><p id=""><strong id="">Conservatism bias:</strong> Emphasizing original or pre-existing information over new information</p><p id="">Highly applicable to decision-makers when reacting to new developments in their field</p><p id="">New information should be analyzed carefully to determine its value</p><p id=""><strong id="">Social Desirability Bias:</strong> Our tendency to respond in ways that we feel are more appropriate or socially acceptable to others, even if we're untruthful</p><p id="">Enter: The anonymous survey</p><p id=""><strong id="">Identifiable Victim Bias:</strong> We feel greater empathy in situations where tragedies are about a specific, identifiable individual, compared to situations where the victims are a larger, vaguer group of people</p><p id="">"A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.”</p><p id=""><strong id="">Peltzman Effect:</strong> The theory that when safety measures are implemented, people actually tend to increase their risky behaviors</p><p id="">Why? People’s perception of risk decreases, and so people may feel that they can now afford to make riskier decisions</p><p id=""><strong id="">Omission Bias:</strong> The tendency to view harmful inactions as more morally sound than harmful actions</p><p id="">Example 1: Referees avoiding game altering calls near the end of tight games</p><p id="">Example 2: Not vaccinating even though the probability of harm is greater without vaccination</p><p id=""><strong id="">In-group Bias:</strong> We favour those with perceived or real similarities to ourselves: race/ethnicity, country of origin, sporting team, political views, etc.</p><p id="">Areas where awareness of ingroup bias is important: Hiring, promotions, politics, capital allocation, team selection</p><p id=""><strong id="">Moral Foundations Theory:</strong> We have ingrained ‘intuitive morals’ which drive all our behaviours</p><p id="">They include:</p><p id="">Care: instinct to protect</p><p id="">Purity: disgust for the foul</p><p id="">Fairness: instinct to punish cheating</p><p id="">Loyalty: how tied you feel to others</p><p id="">Authority: knowing when to obey</p><p id="">We're prewired with the five modules, but each of them can be amplified or toned down by our personality, environment, and experiences</p><p id="">The outcome is differing moral and political views across and within cultures</p><p id="">To avoid political or moral 'high-ground' shouting-matches, seek first to understand the opponent's moral foundations</p><p id="">You'll have a more fruitful conversation and learn a new valuable perspective</p><p id=""><strong id="">Decline of Violence:</strong> The modern world is witnessing a massive decline in all forms of violence such as war, crime, and interpersonal relationships (see@sapinker's The Better Angels of Our Nature), yet we are accustomed to thinking the modern world is increasingly violent</p><p id="">This thinking comes from the persistently horrific stories in the news: murders, geopolitical wars, abuse</p><p id="">It results from the availability bias: the tendency to judge the probability of an event occurring based on how easily it comes to mind</p><p id="">Since the news disproportionately reports on bad things happening (that's what gets clicks!), we overestimate how common these rare bad events are because they are fresh in our memory</p><p id="">Antidote: Remember the whole story, not just the available story</p><p id=""><strong id="">Fox vs. Hedgehogs</strong></p><p id="">There are two types of people in the world: foxes and hedgehogs</p><p id="">The dichotomy describes two contrasting ways of viewing the world</p><p id="">If you adopt foxlike thinking, you rely on various pieces of information to form your view on an issue and think about it from different angles</p><p id="">If you adopt a hedgehog mindset, your world views and predictions are formed with a central, overarching principle in mind</p><p id="">Foxes are willing to admit when they're uncertain in the face of difficult problems</p><p id="">Hedgehogs are more confident in their views, regardless of the uncertainty of the problem at hand</p><p id="">Unsurprisingly, people with foxlike characteristics tend to make more accurate predictions when it comes to global trends and events</p><p id="">The best forecasters put their own theories aside, embrace uncertainty, and use multiple perspectives to achieve a more accurate prediction</p><p id=""><strong id="">Bandwagon Effect:</strong> Ideas, fads, and beliefs grow as more people adopt them</p><p id="">This concept has heavy overlap with Social Proof and the Technology Adoption Lifecyle</p><p id="">A lot of modern marketing techniques can be explained through these concepts</p><p id=""><strong id="">Groupthink:</strong> Due to a desire to 'fit-in' and to retain harmony in group settings, we make irrational decisions, often to minimise conflict</p><p id="">Solutions? Six thinking hats, write storming, and any other process that forces more objective group decision-making</p><p id=""><strong id="">Halo Effect:</strong> The tendency to assume other agreeable characteristics upon seeing one agreeable characteristic in someone or something</p><p id="">" He could never have done that; he's too nice!”</p><p id=""><strong id="">Moral Luck:</strong> Where someone is assigned blame or praise for an action or its consequences even if it's clear that the person didn't have full control over the action or its consequences</p><p id="">Assess voluntary actions, not uncontrollable outcomes</p><p id=""><strong id="">False consensus:</strong> The tendency to believe that your views and behaviours are more common and appropriate to existing circumstances than they are</p><p id="">"What, you don't drink alcohol?!”</p><p id=""><strong id="">Curse of knowledge:</strong> Once we know something, we assume everyone else knows it, too</p><p id="">It's why some experts can't explain their field in simple terms</p><p id="">and people don't share knowledge that could benefit others; there are always people to teach and people to learn from</p><p id=""><strong id="">Spotlight effect:</strong> We overestimate how much people are paying attention to our behaviour and appearance</p><p id="">Hard truth that will pull the weight off your shoulders: People care far more about themselves than they care about you</p><p id="">Simple but hard antidote: Just be you</p><p id=""><strong id="">Defensive Attribution:</strong> When someone attributes blame for a mishap to minimize their fear of being a victim or a cause in a similar situation</p><p id="">Attributing blame allows the person to believe that the mishap was controllable and thus preventable</p><p id="">Example: you want to feel better or less scared after a car crash happens in front of you</p><p id="">You blame one of the drivers for being on their phone and tell yourself it couldn't have happened otherwise</p><p id="">Interestingly, the willingness of the attributor to apportion blame to the person(s) involved has been found to decrease with the perceived similarities between the two parties</p><p id="">I.e., there is an "In-group bias" that occurs</p><p id=""><strong id="">Just-World Hypothesis:</strong> We tend to believe the world is a just place; therefore, we assume acts of injustice are deserved and vice-versa</p><p id="">This is not always the case: good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people</p><p id="">However, it's refreshing and powerful to think that good equals good</p><p id="">Without this hypothesis, the motivation to do good would dissolve</p><h1 id="">That's it, thanks for reading!</h1><p id="">If you got value out of this, I'd appreciate you <a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nZXRyZXZ1ZS5jby9wcm9maWxlL2FsZXhicm9nYW4iLCJwb3N0X2lkIjoiNmI5NmIyMDEtZjA4Zi00NGM5LTk4NDMtMDMzOGFlZGQ0ODJhIiwicHVibGljYXRpb25faWQiOiIxMzdkNWU4My05NTAzLTRkYjctYThjNC1mMzQxNWMyMDU1YWUiLCJ2aXNpdF90b2tlbiI6IjEyMDRlY2U3LTk4OGYtNGFjZC1iNzgwLTAzNmMxY2VlMTA2YiIsImlhdCI6MTY3ODc0NzYxMC41NzcsImlzcyI6Im9yY2hpZCJ9.tLTCu33WX_8KtriG3HY6VDJ3p1TY7wrJlGRbGd07kq4" target="_blank" id="">sharing it</a> or my <a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3R3aXR0ZXIuY29tL19hbGV4YnJvZ2FuIiwicG9zdF9pZCI6IjZiOTZiMjAxLWYwOGYtNDRjOS05ODQzLTAzMzhhZWRkNDgyYSIsInB1YmxpY2F0aW9uX2lkIjoiMTM3ZDVlODMtOTUwMy00ZGI3LWE4YzQtZjM0MTVjMjA1NWFlIiwidmlzaXRfdG9rZW4iOiIxMjA0ZWNlNy05ODhmLTRhY2QtYjc4MC0wMzZjMWNlZTEwNmIiLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzg3NDc2MTAuNTc3LCJpc3MiOiJvcmNoaWQifQ.1kmNYC1MhXzpw9OoY0hoNTyK4T3pr8Ny5JNuKpnpOvE" target="_blank" id="">Twitter profile</a> on Twitter so others can get wiser too :)</p><p id="">Please send me a reply if you have feedback on either of the following questions:</p><ul id=""><li id="">Was the level of explanation sufficient to understand the concept?</li><li id="">Would you like to see each week 'themed' by topic, or would you prefer a mix of fields each week?</li></ul><p>‍</p>
