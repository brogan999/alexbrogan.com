## Fast Summary

- Difficult conversations are a necessary evil both in and out of the
  workplace. We can’t skip them, so instead, we must learn to navigate
  them positively.
- To tackle uncomfortable conversations, we need to first use an
  integrative mindset, which allows us to adapt and remain neutral when
  faced with difficulty.
- Acknowledging our own discomforts, managing our emotions, and
  adjusting our communication approach is key to handling difficult
  conversations with ease.
- Next time you have a difficult conversation, focus on your goals and

Throughout my early career, I struggled to engage in difficult
conversations, especially those that stretched my comfort zone, involved
crucial feedback, or addressed poor performance either from myself or
others.

The issue only worsened when I had to face my superiors—like many, I
found myself mincing words or beating around the bush. And ultimately, I
put these conversations off, avoiding them entirely.

Difficult conversations take many forms—personally, I struggled with
those that involved critical feedback, but you may struggle addressing
your boss or higher-ups in the workplace, partners, friends, and even
family.

Many of us worry about disappointing the other person. Confronting
someone knowing you might disappoint them is daunting, especially when
you may be at fault. And more so, many struggle to engage with those
they find ‘volatile:’ If your boss is known for a short temper and
booming voice, in all likelihood, you’re less likely to approach them
with a potential issue.

We don’t like disappointing people, and that’s perfectly normal.

Mastering difficult conversations is paramount for personal,
professional, and organizational success. When encountered with
conflict, many people find themselves at a loss for words, just as I
did, but this doesn’t help you, and only aggravates the conflict.

Putting them off doesn’t help either. When we continually put off
uncomfortable conversations, the problem swells and worsens over time.

However, when we master tough conversations, we’re more likely to
resolve conflicts, improve personal performance and self-confidence,
and, most importantly, get what we want.

To conquer my fears and master difficult, often uncomfortable,
conversations, I used a combination of approaches and mindset shifts,
building off what Forbes writer Lindy Bewster calls <a

integrator mindset.</a> 

## The Power of The Integrator Mindset…

The integrator mindset is characterized by trust and adaptivity; it
involves approaching potential issues with personal and organizational
goals in mind.

The integrator mindset is rooted in principles of adaptivity: When we
adopt this mindset, we see that there are “numerous ways to achieve
success,” and adjust our approach accordingly.

So how does this mindset help you master difficult conversations?

When we approach potential conflict with an integrator mindset, we
approach others non-confrontationally with specific goals in mind.
Approaching others with confidence and tact is important—people respond
more favorably to neutrality and to those they deem confident.

For example, perhaps a peer approaches you with an issue in your latest
project. They’re angry—furious even—and blame you for the problem
entirely. They use harsh language, asking you, “Why on Earth didn’t you
do this the way I said?”

You wouldn’t respond positively, right? Maybe you had a reason for doing
the project that way, and their inability to adapt and adjust their
approach aggravated what could’ve otherwise been a minor tweak.

In this example, the peer didn’t use the integrator mindset.

Guess what? You can.

## Embracing Discomfort and Difficult Emotions

It’s likely you’ll feel a certain degree of discomfort when approaching
and maintaining difficult conversations.

When facing a potentially uncomfortable conversation, we become anxious,
on edge, and sometimes angry—that’s why we put them off to begin with.

We can’t ignore these feelings in any context, especially this one. The
other person with whom you’re conversing can sense you’re on edge and
would be more likely to react unfavorably.

To navigate these, I started acknowledging my own discomfort. When we
understand what we’re feeling and put a name to it, we take away its
power.

When I began embracing discomfort, both personally and professionally, I
was able to manage difficult conversations, and more often than not,
achieve positive results.

Before difficult conversations, try deep breathing, pinpointing areas of
emotional discomfort, and goal-setting. You’ll relieve your sense of
‘edge’ or ‘nervousness.’

Embracing the discomfort and acknowledging the other person’s concerns
is paramount and directly relates to the integrator mindset.

You’ll feel uncomfortable at first, but it’ll be incredibly influential
to your professional and personal growth over time.

## Simple Communication Strategies (Verbal & Nonverbal)

First things first, the most important strategy you can implement is
preparation. “Failure to prepare is preparing to fail,” after all,
right? Preparation goes hand-in-hand with emotional regulation and the
integrator mindset.

To prepare, consider your desired outcome and think about the necessary
information. Ask yourself your goal, and consider your audience: How
will they react to this information?

target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Harvard University’s
professional development publication</a> notes the following tips on
verbal communication when engaging in uncomfortable conversations:

- Use clear, concise language
- Repeat information only when it's necessary
- Focus on your tone: The volume at which you’re speaking, the language
  you use, and your intonation (the tone and manner in which you’re
  speaking)

Nonverbal communication strategies build trust and rapport between you
and the other person, and involve how you stand, use hand movements, and
express yourself.

As I said, people are more receptive to those who they deem open and
honest, and studies show that nonverbal cues are between <a

impactful than the words we use.

The following strategies will work wonders for you:

- Maintaining eye contact
- Using gestures to punctuate your words and sentences
- Standing up straight and with confidence
- Monitoring facial expressions and remaining neutral
- Providing the other person your full attention

When you build trust and rapport prior to and during a tough
conversation, the other person is more likely to remain receptive to
your message. When you start paying attention to your tone, language,
and posture, those around you will take note.

## Difficult People

I’ve met my fair share of difficult people, and oftentimes there’s no
way around dealing with them. Bosses, family members, and co-workers can
be real pains at times, but by focusing on accommodating them and
adapting (there’s that word again), you can maintain positive
interactions with them as you would anyone else!

In many ways, difficult people are much the same as those who ‘go with
the flow.’

I use these strategies to manage my interactions with difficult people,
and I highly recommend them:

- Remain neutral and non-judgemental throughout the conversation, paying
  attention to your facial expressions
- Reflect respect
- Be curious and constructive. Approach the conversation as if it were a
  problem to solve and you’re optimizing for low emotion and maximum
  outcome
- Ask neutral questions. Instead of saying “Why did you do this?” ask
  about their intentions
- Don’t approach them defensively
- Set personal limits and boundaries
- Leave the conversation if things escalate

By combining the integrator leadership style, embracing difficult
emotions, implementing scientifically proven effective communication
skills, and using techniques to deal with difficult people, I’ve been
able to significantly improve my personal and workplace conduct for the
better.

Using the positive communication and adaptive strategies we’ve
discussed, you too can master difficult conversations with difficult
people.

## This Practical Challenge

I ask you to think back to a difficult conversation you’ve encountered
and to consider how these strategies might’ve changed the outcome. Write
down your answers to these questions, and take a moment to reflect on
your actions.

1.  Recall what happened during the conversation:
2.  a. What was your initial objective? How did you approach the other
    person? Was your approach fruitful?
3.  b. Be brutally honest with yourself—if you’re thinking of a
    difficult conversation, it’s likely it didn’t end the way you
    initially hoped. Write down a brief overview of what happened, and
    why it didn’t end the way you’d intended.

<!-- -->

1.  Consider the communication strategies you used.
2.  a. Which verbal communications strategies did you use: Did you
    respond neutrally and with confidence? Did you listen and pay
    attention while the other person was speaking?
3.  b. Which verbal strategies explained in this newsletter did you need
    to use?
4.  c. Did you utilize any nonverbal strategies? Which ones?
5.  d. Which nonverbal strategies did you forego?

<!-- -->

1.  Finally, map out what would’ve happened had you implemented the
    techniques we discussed.
2.  a. Consider these techniques both in the context of the conversation
    and in the context of those you may have in the future.
3.  b. Which communications strategies and approaches feel most natural
    to you?

Take a look at what you’ve written, and use it to guide your next
difficult conversation.

It’s time to put these into action and (finally) achieve your desired
results both in and outside the workplace.
