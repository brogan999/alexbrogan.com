*“On a hot summer day, a thirsty crow flew around searching for water.
It had been a long day, and the crow was growing increasingly desperate.
Finally, it came across a pitcher with a small amount of water at the
bottom.*

*The crow tried to reach the water, but the pitcher was too deep and its
neck too narrow for the crow to fit its beak inside.Feeling
disheartened, the crow could have given up and continued searching for
water elsewhere.*

*However, instead of surrendering to despair, the crow decided to think
creatively and find a solution to its predicament.The crow noticed a
pile of small stones nearby and devised a plan. It began picking up the
stones one by one and dropping them into the pitcher.*

*Slowly but surely, the water level inside the pitcher began to rise as
the stones displaced the water. Eventually, the water reached a level
high enough for the crow to drink.”*

*‍*The Crow and the Pitcher serves as a timeless reminder that the power
to overcome adversity lies within our own resilience, resourcefulness,
and adaptability. By embracing these qualities, we can tackle challenges
head-on and continue to progress towards our goals, even when the odds
seem stacked against us.
