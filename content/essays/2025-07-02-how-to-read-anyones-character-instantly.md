<p id=""><strong id="">(1) Observe Their Partner</strong><br><em id="">Who people choose to partner with says more than anything they say. It tells us more about their desires, assumptions, and needs than anything else. It indicates their priorities and values, as well as what they think of themselves.</em></p><p id=""><strong id="">(2) Observe How They Handle No</strong><br><em id="">Rejection is a big part of life. Those who take "No" poorly usually have an overinflated sense of entitlement. The world owes no one anything. Those who accept and live by this are people you can share bad news with easily.</em></p><p id=""><strong id="">(3) Observe How They Handle Success</strong><br><em id="">Freedom of any kind—time, money, or network—is a huge amplifier. But unfortunately, it tends to amplify one’s negative qualities. The characters you want by your side are those who are gracious in victory and defeat.</em></p><p id=""><strong id="">(4) Observe Their Upbringing</strong><br><em id="">People’s character and ability to handle challenges are formed during the first two decades of life. It’s rarely a surprise to find those with the highest levels of resilience as those who have endured the most heartache in their upbringing.</em></p><p id=""><strong id="">(5) Observe Their Calendar &amp; Spending</strong><br><em id="">How someone spends their time and money reveals explicitly what they value. “Show me your calendar and I’ll show you your future.” Actions—or the flow of time and money—reveal what a person is far better than words.</em></p><p id=""><strong id="">(6) Observe Their Talk-To-Listen Ratio</strong><br><em id="">In a social setting, someone can talk with others, listen, or avoid others. Listeners are rare, valuable, and effective. Exceptional listening correlates strongly with self-awareness, and self-awareness is a key indicator of character.</em></p><p id=""><strong id="">(7) Observe The Small Things</strong><br><em id="">This is a universal rule that many must learn the hard way. People who are dishonest in small things will be dishonest in big things as well. The little actions and words that people make tell you a lot about how they act and what they think.</em></p><p id=""><strong id="">(8) Observe Them Around Friends</strong><br><em id="">People often reveal their true selves when they’re comfortable around friends. Watch how they treat others, especially those who can’t benefit them. Do they gossip or speak kindly about others? Are they supportive or competitive with their friends?</em></p><p id=""><strong id="">(9) Observe Their Reaction to Stress</strong><br><em id="">Stress brings out people’s core nature. Notice how they handle unexpected challenges or setbacks. Do they remain calm and composed, or do they lash out? Their stress response can reveal much about their emotional intelligence and resilience.</em></p><p id=""><strong id="">(10) Observe Their Consistency</strong><br><em id="">Actions speak louder than words, but consistent actions speak the loudest. Pay attention to whether someone’s behavior aligns with their stated values and beliefs over time. Consistency between words and actions is a strong indicator of integrity and reliability. Those who consistently follow through on their commitments, even when it’s inconvenient, demonstrate dependability and strength.</em></p>
