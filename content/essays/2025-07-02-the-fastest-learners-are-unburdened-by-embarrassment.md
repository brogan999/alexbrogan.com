<p>‍<strong id="">The fastest learners are unburdened by embarrassment.</strong></p><p id="">Think about the last time you were learning something new — a language, a sport, or a skill. Did you hold back from asking questions or practicing in front of others out of fear of looking foolish? Most do.</p><p id="">As Thomas Newkirk put it:<br><strong id="">"Embarrassment is a true enemy of learning."</strong><br>It blocks full engagement with the learning process. It stops us from making the mistakes that growth demands.</p><p id="">Fast learners understand this. They know embarrassment is just temporary discomfort. They’re willing to look silly, ask "dumb" questions, and fail publicly — because that’s where the real growth happens.</p><p id="">They live Alain de Botton’s truth:<br><strong id="">"Anyone who isn't embarrassed by who they were last year probably isn't learning enough."</strong></p><p id="">This is the mindset shift:<br>It’s not that fast learners don’t feel embarrassed — they just don’t let it stop them. They see discomfort as progress. A signal that they’re stretching beyond their current limits.</p><p id=""><strong id="">So if you want to learn faster, start with your relationship to embarrassment.</strong></p><p id="">Don’t avoid it — use it. Ask the questions others won’t. Practice in public, even when you’re not ready. Make mistakes loudly.</p><p id="">Because the sting of embarrassment is nothing compared to the speed of growth that follows.</p><p id=""><strong id="">The fastest learners aren’t those who never feel embarrassed — they’re the ones who feel it and move forward anyway.</strong></p>
