<p id="">Welcome to the <strong id="">300(!)</strong> new friends of the Mental Models, Concepts, and Frameworks newsletter who have joined us since last week!</p><h1 id="">This Week: 10 mental models that will make you smarter</h1><h2 id="">Agenda-Setting Theory</h2><p id="">Mainstream media sets the agenda of public discourse.</p><p id="">The more attention the media gives to certain issues, the more likely the public is to consider them important.</p><p id="">Don’t pay blind attention to what’s on the “agenda” and forget what’s not being said.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640faa16d125056a716f60f0_image.jpeg" id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2 id="">The Ergodic Switch</h2><p id="">In an ergodic scenario, the average outcome of a group is the same as the average outcome of the individual over time.</p><p id="">We are taught to think that most systems are ergodic.</p><p id="">In reality, most human systems are non-ergodic.</p><p id="">Don’t blindly believe in averages.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640fa72b44df3640f94ba6c1_image.jpeg" id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2 id="">Convexity</h2><p id="">Convex payoffs have larger gains than pains—the potential upside is greater than the downside.</p><p id="">The majority seek to cap downside by entering conformist professions but in doing so, cap their upside too.</p><p id="">Lesson: Incorporate some calculated risks in your plan.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640faa16cfbab5d6879c26be_image.png" id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2 id="">The Map is Not the Territory</h2><p id="">No model is a perfect representation of reality, but some are still useful.</p><p id="">The more complicated the system or territory, the greater the chance of inconsistencies.</p><p id="">You don’t truly understand a model or map unless you know its limitations.</p><h2 id="">Wisdom of the Crowd</h2><p id="">The intelligence of a diverse group is superior to that of any of the individuals within the group.</p><p id="">A useful framework for solving difficult problems.</p><p id="">When possible, seek multiple diverse and alternative perspectives for better solutions.</p><h2 id="">The Paradox of Abundance</h2><p id="">The average quality of information is decreasing over time.</p><p id="">But the highest quality stuff gets better and better.</p><p id="">Abundance is simultaneously bad for the 'median' consumer but good for the 'conscious, discerning' consumer who filters out noise.</p><h2 id="">Google Scholar Effect</h2><p id="">Highly cited papers appear in top positions and gain ever more citations.</p><p id="">New papers struggle to appear in top positions and therefore get less attention, regardless of their contribution to their fields.</p><p id="">Where else is a cumulative advantage at play?</p><h2 id="">Curse of Knowledge</h2><p id="">Once we know something, we assume everyone else knows it, too.</p><p id="">It's why some experts can't explain their field in simple terms and people don't share knowledge that could benefit others.</p><p id="">Lesson: There are always people to teach and people to learn from.</p><h2 id="">Predictive Coding</h2><p id="">“You experience, in some sense, the world that you expect to experience.”</p><p id="">—Andy Clark</p><p id="">Our perception replaces the unknown with the expected to help us organize our experience of the world efficiently.</p><p id="">Ask, “What might you be over-predicting?”</p><h2 id="">Locus of Control</h2><p id="">Internal: You believe that outcomes are within your control.</p><p id="">External: You believe that outcomes are outside of your control.</p><p id="">The more control you believe you have, the less likely you are to conform to the status quo.</p><p id="">Seek to believe in control.</p><p>‍</p>
