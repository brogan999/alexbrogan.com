<p id="">Welcome to the new friends of the A Players newsletter who have joined us since last week!</p><h1 id="">This Week:&nbsp;10 mental models that will make you smarter </h1><h2 id="">Consensus-Contrarian Matrix</h2><p id="">In order to produce outsized returns in any given area, you have to both bet against the convention and be right. </p><p id="">‚ÄùYou can‚Äôt take the same actions as everyone else and expect to outperform.‚Äù</p><p id="">‚ÄîHoward Marks</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640d564cea9ad6415cf67f77_image.png" id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2 id="">Curse of Knowledge </h2><p id="">Once we know something, we assume everyone else knows it, too.</p><p id="">It's why some experts can't explain their field in simple terms and people don't share knowledge that could benefit others. </p><p id="">Lesson: There are always people to teach and people to learn from.</p><h2 id="">Perfect Solution Fallacy</h2><p id="">We reject something because it compares poorly to an ideal that in reality is unattainable.</p><p id="">We assume there is a perfect solution to every problem.</p><p id="">Reality is more complicated and trade-offs exist.</p><p id="">Take the option with the most bearable trade-offs.</p><h2 id="">Pessimism Bias</h2><p id="">We overestimate the likelihood of negative outcomes.</p><p id="">Evolutionary speaking this developed as a defence mechanism and served us well.</p><p id="">We heard a noise in the bushes and ran.</p><p id="">This doesn't apply anymore: we've never lived in a safer world. </p><p id="">Be an optimist.</p><h2 id="">The Gatekeepers</h2><p id="">There are points along communication channels where decisions are made about what‚Äôs included and what gets left out. </p><p id="">The people who have the power to operate these gates heavily influence the flow of information.</p><p id="">Where possible, seek information first-hand.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image

height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2 id="">Domain Dependence</h2><p id="">What you master in one domain (area) is difficult to transfer to another. </p><p id="">‚ÄúIn theory, there is no difference between theory and practice, but in practice there is.‚Äù</p><p id="">‚ÄîYogi Berra</p><p id="">Expand your areas of learning and don‚Äôt become trapped by single domains.</p><figure

id="">‚ÄùYour social standing directly affects your health and life expectancy. </p><p id="">Autonomy, your sense of control over your life and social connectedness, rather than financial resources, have the greatest impact on your longevity.‚Äù</p><p id="">‚ÄîMichael Marmot</p><h2 id="">Purposeful Stupidity</h2><p id="">The inner workings of most organisations make more sense when viewed through the lense of the ‚ÄúPurposeful Stupidity‚Äù instructions.</p><p id="">Namely, the Simple Sabotage Field Manual, by the Office of Strategic Services (Now CIA). </p><p id="">Source: <a

id="">Addition by Subtraction</h2><p id="">Sometimes, to make something better, you must take something away. </p><p id="">Over-engineering leads to more ‚Äòbreakpoints‚Äô: sources of potential problems. </p><p id="">Reducing components or complexity can add value by making something: </p><p id="">‚Ä¢ Simpler</p><p id="">‚Ä¢ More reliable</p><p id="">‚Ä¢ Faster</p><h2 id="">Physics Envy</h2><p id="">The common human craving to reduce extremely complex systems‚Äîsuch as Economics‚Äîto one-size-fits-all Newtonian formulas.</p><p id="">In complex systems, everything is interacting with everything else. </p><p id="">This makes it nearly impossible to predict the final outcome accurately.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image"
