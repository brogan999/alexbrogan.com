This improves our ability to solve the problems in front of us</p><p id=""><strong id="">Interpretation and Reinterpretation</strong></p><p id="">When there‚Äôs not enough information to develop an accurate pattern, we rely on prior information to make interpretations</p><p id="">Reinterpration involves changing your beliefs about a past event‚Äîit's a powerful tool to overcome negative experiences</p><p id=""><strong id="">Motivation</strong></p><p id="">An emotional state that links the parts of your brain that feel with the parts responsible for action</p><p id="">Motivation results from no conflict or confusion over the best course of action‚Äîit can involve moving towards something desirable or away from something undesirable</p><p id=""><strong id="">Inhibition</strong></p><p id="">The ability to temporarily override our natural inclinations (habits)</p><p id="">Willpower is the fuel of Inhibition. Whenever we inhibit our natural responses to our environment, willpower is at work</p><p id="">However, we only have limited willpower, so must use inhibition sparingly</p><p id=""><strong id="">Status Signals</strong></p><p id="">Tangible indicators of an intangible quality that increases a person's status or group affiliation. Rare or expensive items, awards, honors, etc.</p><p id="">Whenever possible, we should avoid playing "status" games, and do things that are intrinsically motivating to us</p><p id=""><strong id="">Status Malfunction</strong></p><p id="">The more attractive an option looks in terms of "status", the more likely it is to have drawbacks, and the more likely you are to ignore those drawbacks and pursue that option anyway</p><p id="">Be willing to ignore shiny distractions for meaningful work</p><p id=""><strong id="">Threat Lockdown (Fight-or-flight response)</strong></p><p id="">A heightened protective mode your mind and body enter when they sense an impending external threat</p><p id="">To overcome this mode, we must convince our mind that the threat no longer exists or never truly existed to the extent we believed</p><p id=""><strong id="">Cognitive Scope Limitation</strong></p><p id="">Our minds tendency to simplify reality in the face of overwhelming information. Can lead to suboptimal decisions as we fail to consider the full "scope" of the issue</p><p id="">‚ÄúOne death is a tragedy. A million deaths is a statistic.‚Äù‚ÄîKurt Tucholsky</p><p id=""><strong id="">Association</strong></p><p id="">The tendency of the human mind to store information contextually. We constantly look for patterns, even when they don't exist, this can lead to associations forming between things that aren't logically connected</p><p id=""><strong id="">Absence Blindness</strong></p><p id="">When you don‚Äôt notice or pay attention to things that are going well</p><p id="">Example: We tend to notice referee's only when they perform poorly</p><p id="">To judge fairly, we should be conscious of this bias and ensure we pay as much attention to good work as bad work</p><p id=""><strong id="">Novelty</strong></p><p id="">Novelty is the presence of new sensory data. Human attention needs novelty to sustain itself</p><p id="">Novelty is paramount if you want to attract and maintain attention over a long period of time</p><p id="">Continue offering something new, and people will keep paying attention</p><p id=""><strong id="">False Precision (Roughly Right &gt; Precisely Wrong)</strong></p><p id="">Occurs when numerical data is presented in a manner that implies better precision than is justified</p><p id="">It's the belief that greater precision implies greater accuracy</p><p id="">Are you getting more useful data or just more data in general?</p><p id=""><strong id="">Weber-Fechner Law</strong></p><p id="">We tend to only perceive a change in a stimulus from any sense (sight, hearing, taste, touch, smell) if that change is at least equal to the pre-existing stimulus</p><p id="">Can you notice which half (left or right) increased in number of dots?</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640fb02524545cc834622093_FNGkw9NXEAITIdy.jpeg" id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p id=""><strong id="">Congruence Bias</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to over-rely on testing an initial hypothesis while neglecting to test alternative hypotheses</p><p id="">That is, people rarely try experiments that could disprove their initial belief, but rather try to repeat their initial results (form of confirmation bias)</p><p id=""><strong id="">Continued Influence Effect</strong></p><p id="">Exposure to misinformation continues to impact belief and reasoning, even if that misinformation has been corrected</p><p id="">This effect is highly relevant in today's world of persistent fake news and misinformation‚Äîdon't believe everything you see and hear</p><p id=""><strong id="">Bucket Error</strong></p><p id="">When multiple different concepts or variables are incorrectly lumped together in one's mind as a single concept/variable</p><p id="">You believe you can only become a writer if you don't make spelling mistakes; however, the two concepts are in fact separate variables</p><p id=""><strong id="">Law of Narrative Gravity</strong></p><p id="">The public and press are drawn to narratives, and the more widely accepted a narrative, the more it attracts and shapes the perception of facts</p><p id="">Explains why it's critical to shape your own narrative as a company or individual before others do</p><p id=""><strong id="">Anecdotal Fallacy</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to use a personal experience or an isolated example instead of a sound argument or compelling evidence</p><p id="">Quantitative scientific measures are almost always more accurate than personal perceptions and experiences</p><p id=""><strong id="">Masked Man Fallacy</strong></p><p id="">A fallacy of inferring that since one knows (or does not know) something by one description, one must know (or not know) it by another</p><p id="">"I know who my father is. I do not know who the masked man is. Therefore, my father is not the masked man.‚Äù</p><p id=""><strong id="">Recency Illusion</strong></p><p id="">The belief that things you have noticed only recently are in fact recent‚Äîor have only just come into existence</p><p id="">"Whoa, that's new to me. It must be new to the world!"</p><p id="">When we think something is new, we treat it as new, and therefore miss important context</p><p id=""><strong id="">Anthropomorphism</strong></p><p id="">The attribution of human traits, emotions, or intentions to non-human things‚Äîit helps us make sense of the behaviours and events we encounter</p><p id="">However, perceiving the presence of human qualities in other entities can be misleading when such qualities are absent</p><p id=""><strong id="">Essentialism</strong></p><p id="">The belief that groups of people, such as men and women, have different basic characteristics that cannot be changed and that are necessary to their identity</p><p id="">Beware of this belief as it can lead to rigid thinking and perception of our surrounding environment</p><p id=""><strong id="">Cheerleader Effect</strong></p><p id="">The cognitive bias which causes people to think individuals are more attractive when they are in a group</p><p id="">Arises from a tendency of the mind to not process every individual detail they perceive, but rather summarise or categorise information as a group</p><p id=""><strong id="">Mental Accounting</strong></p><p id="">A tendency to place different values on the same amount of money, based on subjective criteria, often with detrimental results</p><p id="">Helps explain why people are willing to spend more when they pay with a credit card than cash</p><p id=""><strong id="">Appeal To Probability Fallacy</strong></p><p id="">Asserting that since something is probably the case, it is certainly the case</p><p id="">‚ÄúIf I keep doing this long enough, I will probably succeed; therefore, I will succeed.‚Äù</p><p id=""><strong id="">Magic Number (7+-2)</strong></p><p id="">The average person can only keep 7 ¬± 2 items in their short-term working memory</p><p id="">Humans can process finite information.

Are you sure?</p><p id=""><strong id="">Risk Compensation</strong></p><p id="">People adjust their behavior in response to perceived levels of risk, becoming more careful where they sense greater risk and less careful if they feel more protected</p><p id="">Counterintuitively, this can lead to greater risk-seeking behaviour in "safe" environments</p><p id=""><strong id="">Armchair Fallacy</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to be confident in critising other people's work, even if we are less informed in the area of the work than they are</p><p id="">Remember: It's a hundred times easeier to criticize than create</p><p id=""><strong id="">Appeal to Novelty Fallacy</strong></p><p id="">Claiming that something must be superior simply because it's "new"‚Äîcan apply to a product or idea</p><p id="">"Keeping up with the latest trends is always an excellent idea."</p><p id="">Good things tend to stick around for a reason (The Lindy Effect)</p><p id=""><strong id="">Disposition Effect</strong></p><p id="">A tendency to prematurely sell assets that have made gains, while holding on to assets that are losing money</p><p id="">We are driven to sell winning investments to ensure a profit, but are averse to selling losing investments in hopes of turning them into gains</p><p id=""><strong id="">System Justification</strong></p><p id="">A social psychological tendency to defend and bolster the status quo, that is, to see it as good, fair, legitimate, and desirable</p><p id="">This can come at the expense of individual and self-interest if there are better alternatives not being explored</p><p id=""><strong id="">Reverse Psychology</strong></p><p id="">When your true intent is different from what you ask a person to do, you are using reverse psychology</p><p id="">The result is that the other person behaves the way you would genuinely like them to, even though you didn‚Äôt ask them directly</p><p id=""><strong id="">Maslow's Hammer</strong></p><p id="">When we acquire a new skill, we tend to see opportunities to use it everywhere</p><p id="">"If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."</p><p id="">This can make us inefficient by overusing a specific tool instead of the tool best suited to the job at hand</p><p id=""><strong id="">Chesterton's Fence</strong></p><p id="">Reforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing state of affairs is understood</p><p id="">Making great decisions requires understanding previous decisions.
