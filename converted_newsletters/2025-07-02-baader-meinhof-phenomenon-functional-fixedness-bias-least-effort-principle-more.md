Suddenly, you’re aware of that thing all over the place</p><p id="">In reality, there’s no increase in occurrence. It’s just that you’ve started to notice it</p><p id="">Why does it happen? Your brain can't take in every detail and chooses to prioritise certain information</p><p id="">When you're exposed to brand-new information, especially if you find it interesting, your brain will tend to prioritise it in the future</p><p id=""><strong id="">Functional Fixedness Bias</strong></p><p id="">A cognitive bias that limits a person to use an object only in the way it is traditionally used</p><p id="">Functional fixedness is a mental block against using an object in a new way that is required to solve a problem</p><p id="">The "block" limits the ability of an individual to use components given to them to complete a task, as they can't move past the original purpose of those components</p><p id="">E.g., Someone needs a weight, but they only have a hammer, they may not see how the hammer can be used as a weight</p><p id="">Functional fixedness isn't always a bad thing. In many cases, it can act as a mental shortcut allowing you to quickly and efficiently determine a practical use for an object</p><p id="">However, in some cases better thinking results from thinking "outside" traditional uses</p><p id=""><strong id="">Least Effort Principle</strong></p><p id="">A theory suggesting that animals, humans, and well-designed machines will naturally seek the path of least resistance, and that effort declines as the minimum acceptable result is attained</p><p id="">For example, one might consult a generalist co-worker down the hall rather than a specialist in another building, so long as the generalist's answers are within the threshold of acceptability</p><p id="">This obvious issue with this is that it doesn't always lead to the best outcome</p><p id="">A good way to combat this principle is to think through whether the task at hand is a task where the minimum threshold of acceptability is actually acceptable</p><p id="">If lives or a business is on the line, it probably pays to make the extra investment required for a good outcome</p><p id=""><strong id="">Hard-Easy Effect</strong></p><p id="">We tend to overestimate our ability to do something hard and underestimate our ability to do something easy</p><p id="">This leads us to focus on what’s hard even though the thing that’s easy might bring the same, or larger, rewards</p><p id="">For example, imagine that you are learning how to drive and have to complete both a written exam and driving test</p><p id="">Arguably the test is more difficult because it's based on knowledge and skill, whereas the exam is mostly based on knowledge</p><p id="">The hard-easy effect makes you overconfident in your ability to pass the test and underconfident about how likely you are to pass the written exam</p><p id="">As a result, you barely practice driving and focus all your attention on the written exam</p><p id="">On test day, you easily pass the written exam, but since you were too confident about your driving skills, you fail the driving test</p><p id="">This matters because we face uncertainty on a daily basis, and in order to effectively navigate the world, we need to act in a rational manner</p><p id="">The hard-easy effect essentially suggests that we are not being realistic with our abilities and often misplace our confidence</p><p id="">We can avoid this effect through external feedback or honest self-assessment</p><p id=""><strong id="">Focusing Illusion</strong></p><p id="">Nothing is ever as important as what you’re thinking about while you’re thinking about it</p><p id="">Worrying about a thing makes the thing being worried about seem worse than it is</p><p id="">As Marcus Aurelius observed, “We suffer more often in imagination than in reality.”</p><p id=""><strong id="">Reputation Fragility</strong></p><p id="">Reputations are fragile. A person or business gets judged by the worst of their behaviour, and that makes them vulnerable at any point in time</p><p id="">As Warren Buffett says: "It takes 20 years to build a reputation and 5 minutes to ruin it.”</p><p id=""><strong id="">Noise Bottleneck</strong></p><p id="">We think the more information we consume the more signal we’ll consume</p><p id="">However, our ability to comprehend the relevant from the irrelevant becomes compromised in this case</p><p id="">We put too much emphasis on irrelevant data and lose sight of what’s really important</p><p id=""><strong id="">Serpico Effect</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to rationalize an action because everyone else is doing it</p><p id="">Think corporate, government, or police corruption</p><p id="">Named after Frank Serpico, who became known for whistleblowing on police corruption in the late 1960s and early 1970s</p><p id=""><strong id="">Compassion Face</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to have more compassion for victims within small groups than larger groups, because the smaller the group the easier it is to identify individual victims</p><p id="">One victim can break our hearts while larger groups seem more distanced1</p><p id=""><strong id="">Three Men Make a Tiger</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to accept absurd information as long as it's repeated enough times</p><p id="">If one person tells you there’s a tiger in town, you might assume they’re lying. If two people tell you, you begin to wonder</p><p id="">If three tell you, you might start running!</p><p id=""><strong id="">Buridan's Ass</strong></p><p id="">A type of decision paralysis where two equally good options lead to no decision</p><p id="">Described by the example of an Ass that's stuck between two stacks of hay of equal size and quality, and can't decide which to eat, causing it to starve to death from indecision</p><p id=""><strong id="">Semmelweis</strong></p><p id="">Related to first-conclusion and confirmation bias, the Semmelweis reflex is the tendency to reject new evidence or new information because it contradicts established norms, beliefs, or paradigms</p><p id=""><strong id="">Mcnamara Fallacy</strong></p><p id="">The belief that rational decisions are made solely on the basis of quantitative evidence, ignoring all other factors</p><p id="">Don’t presume that what can’t be measured isn’t really important</p><p id=""><strong id="">Courtesy Bias</strong></p><p id="">The resistance to giving an honest opinion due to a desire not to offend the person or organization in question</p><p id="">Example: Employees hesitant to give an honest opinion to their superiors, clogging information flow for rational decision making in a company</p><p id=""><strong id="">Lucid Fallacy</strong></p><p id="">Identified by @nntaleb, the ludic fallacy is the tendency to falsely associate simulations with real life</p><p id="">Because simulations are designed as “narrow worlds of game and dice”, they fail to account for chaos regarding future events in the real world</p><p id=""><strong id="">Abilene Paradox (Pluralistic Ignorance)</strong></p><p id="">The situation where a group decides to make a decision that is counter to the thoughts and feelings of its individual members in the group</p><p id="">It happens because the members fail to communicate their individual beliefs</p><p id=""><strong id="">Collective Narcissism</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to exaggerate the positive image and importance of a group that one belongs to</p><p id=""><strong id="">Normalcy Bias</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to believe threats and disasters are not at all probable due to a belief that things will remain as they always have</p><p id=""><strong id="">Behavioural Inevitability</strong></p><p id="">The notion that human behavior, and its inherent biases, will always remain</p><p id="">As Voltaire said: History never repeats itself; man always does</p><p id=""><strong id="">False Uniqueness Effect</strong></p><p id="">An attributional cognitive error of assuming that one’s qualities, traits, and personal attributes are unique when in reality they are not</p><p id="">In essence, it’s the opposite of imposter syndrome</p><p id=""><strong id="">Positive Illusions</strong></p><p id="">A form of self-deception that causes individuals to think inflatedly about themselves and their abilities to avoid short-term discomfort or raise self-esteem</p><p id="">A positive illusion might cause a negative spiral of justifications about worse and worse decisions</p><p id=""><strong id="">Ironic Process Theory</strong></p><p id="">The psychological process of attempting to suppress certain thoughts, making those thoughts more likely to resurface in one’s mind</p><p id="">An example is how when someone is actively trying not to think of a bear they may actually be more likely to imagine one</p><p id=""><strong id="">Aumann's Agreement Theorem</strong></p><p id="">The notion that two rational people in an opposing argument can’t and shouldn’t come to the conclusion of agreeing to disagree if they have common knowledge of each other’s beliefs</p><p id="">In other words, it's a cop out or lazy to settle for this</p><p id=""><strong id="">Ostrich Effect</strong></p><p id="">Ostriches bury their heads in the sand to avoid danger. The ostrich effect is the tendency to avoid opposing information to what one desperately wants to be right</p><p id="">Can mean avoiding believing negative information and allowing a problem to become a bigger problem</p><p id=""><strong id="">Bounded Rationality</strong></p><p id="">Limits to the capacity of the mind make it impossible to contain and recall all information obtained, and therefore, rationality is also limited</p><p id="">This causes us to make choices that are satisfactory rather than optimal (to satisfice, rather than optimize)</p><p id=""><strong id="">Fluency Heuristic</strong></p><p id="">Related to the narrative fallacy, fluency heuristic is the tendency to believe more in ideas that are easy to explain rather than those that are hard to comprehend</p><p id=""><strong id="">Persian Messenger Syndrome</strong></p><p id="">The act of blaming the bearer of negative news</p><p id="">Ancient Persians actually killed some messengers whose sole fault was that they brought home truthful bad news, say, of a battle lost</p><p id=""><strong id="">Okrent's Law</strong></p><p id="">A law stated by writer Daniel Okrent referring to the phenomenon of the press providing legitimacy to unsupported fringe viewpoints in an effort to appear even-handed</p><p id="">He once said: The pursuit of balance can create imbalance because sometimes something is true</p><p id=""><strong id="">Veirordt's Law</strong></p><p id="">In 1868, German physiologist Karl von Vierordt created this law stating that humans perceive time at different magnitudes over different durations</p><p id="">We underestimate long periods of time and overestimate short periods of time</p><p id=""><strong id="">Cunningham's Law</strong></p><p id="">The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question. It’s to post the wrong answer</p><p id="">If you express anger in your private conversations, your friends will find you tiresome, but when there’s an audience, outrage can boost status</p><p id=""><strong id="">Delayed Gratification</strong></p><p id="">The process an individual undergoes when resisting the temptation of an immediate reward in preference for a later reward</p><p id="">We live in a world of instant gratification: those who master the power of delayed gratification are the ones who win long term</p><p id=""><strong id="">Base Rate Neglect</strong></p><p id="">A tendency to ignore the a priori probability of something by putting heavier weight on appealing information about an individual’s case</p><p id="">Only 3% of applicants make it into this school, but my daughter is brilliant. I’m sure they’re going to accept her!</p><p id=""><strong id="">Neglect of Probability</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to disregard probability in decision making under uncertainty. Small risks are either neglected entirely or hugely overrated</p><p id="">Hindsight bias is a common result of the tendency to neglect probability</p><p id=""><strong id="">Friendship Paradox</strong></p><p id="">Most people have fewer friends than their friends have, on average</p><p id="">People with more friends are more likely to be one of your friends (sampling bias)</p><p id="">In reality, it's a contradiction because most people believe they have more friends than their friends have</p><p id=""><strong id="">Woozle Effect</strong></p><p id="">When frequent citation of previous information that lacks evidence misleads individuals into believing it’s evidence</p><p id="">"A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth”</p><p id=""><strong id="">Ringelmann Effect</strong></p><p id="">As a group size increases, individuals tend to become increasingly less productive</p><p id="">Consider a tug of war. As more people are involved, their average performance tends to decrease because each participant feels that their own effort is not critical</p><p id=""><strong id="">Group Attribution Error</strong></p><p id="">Falsely assuming that the views and decision outcomes of a collective group reflect the view of each member in that group, even when information is available that indicates that all members do not support the decision</p><p id="">Closely related to stereotyping</p><p id=""><strong id="">90-9-1 Rule</strong></p><p id="">In a social media network (E.g., Twitter), only 1 percent of users will actively create content; another 9 percent will participate by commenting, rating, or sharing the content; and the last 90 percent will watch, look and read without interacting</p><p id=""><strong id="">Braess's Paradox</strong></p><p id="">An observation by German mathematician Dietrich Braess who noticed that adding a road to a particular congested road traffic network would make traffic worse due to an increase in shortcuts becoming popular and overcrowded</p><p id=""><strong id="">Pollyanna Principle</strong></p><p id="">It’s easier to actively remember pleasant memories than bad ones</p><p id="">The mind tends to focus on the optimistic at the subconscious level, while it tends to focus on the negative at the conscious level</p><p id=""><strong id="">Empathy Gap</strong></p><p id="">Underestimating the way behaviour is largely affected by one’s mental state when you're not currently in that mental state</p><p id="">If you feel calm, you'll find it difficult to predict how you'll act if someone angers you</p><p id=""><strong id="">Meat Paradox</strong></p><p id="">Many of us experience the 'meat paradox', whereby we simultaneously care for animals such as cows, yet also consume them as meat</p><p id="">Applies to many other moral issues where we stay in the 'dark', to protect the illusion that we are morally consistent and sensible</p><p id=""><strong id="">Emotional Contagion</strong></p><p id="">The automatic adoption of the emotional state of another person through observation; some are more susceptible to cues than others</p><p id="">Happiness and misery love company</p><p id="">Be careful who you spend your time around, their energy is infectious</p><p id=""><strong id="">Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation</strong></p><p id="">Intrinsic arises when you find something personally or intrinsically rewarding, while extrinsic comes from incentives or punishment</p><p id="">Intrinsic is a better source of long-term motivation, but extrinsic can be used effectively in the short-term</p><p id=""><strong id="">Big Five Personality Traits</strong></p><p id="">The most academically accepted model of basic personality traits, sometimes referred to as the OCEAN model: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism</p><p id="">These factors exist on a continuum and encompass several subfactors</p><p id=""><strong id="">DISC Model</strong></p><p id="">A model of human behaviour commonly used in business settings describing four distinct temperaments that can be found in individuals</p><p id="">D: Dominance</p><p id="">I: Influence</p><p id="">S: Steadiness</p><p id="">C: Compliance</p><p id=""><strong id="">Instrumental Conditioning</strong></p><p id="">Occurs when you choose to continue, or discontinue, a behaviour based on the positive or negative reinforcement you've received for that behaviour previously</p><p id="">Also known as "trial-and-error" learning</p><p id=""><strong id="">Blind spot</strong></p><p id="">An area of thought or perception that goes unchecked and can have negative consequences</p><p id="">Something you systematically overlook either intentionally, but more likely, subconsciously. It leads to a distortion of reality and inferior thinking</p><p id=""><strong id="">Choice-supportive bias</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to remember our choices as better than they actually were</p><p id="">We choose option A over B, we are likely to dismiss faults of A, while amplifying faults of B.
