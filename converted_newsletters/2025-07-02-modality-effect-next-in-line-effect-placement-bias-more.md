This means that images are stored as pictures and words, but words are only stored as words</p><p id=""><strong id="">Positivity effect</strong></p><p id="">The tendency for elderly people to perceive and remember positive images and experiences more than negative ones</p><p id="">A form of selective memory that helps compensate for troubles that occur over the lifetime</p><p id=""><strong id="">Processing difficulty effect</strong></p><p id="">We have an easier time remembering information that takes longer to read and understand</p><p id="">This feels counter-intuitive: we want to make our message simple and short, right? In some cases, yes. But, not all. Making the brain work is a powerful tool</p><p id=""><strong id="">Rosy retrospection</strong></p><p id="">Our tendency to recall the past more fondly than the present</p><p id="">An inaccurate view of past events might lead to judging current or future events unfairly. And without storing negative experiences, you may fail to incorporate constructive feedback</p><p id=""><strong id="">Reminiscence bump</strong></p><p id="">The tendency for older adults (over forty) to have increased or enhanced recollection for events that occurred during their adolescence and early adulthood</p><p id="">Occurs because memory storage in autobiographical memory is not consistent through time</p><p id=""><strong id="">Self-relevance effect</strong></p><p id="">A tendency to encode information differently depending on whether we are implicated in the information</p><p id="">When we are asked to remember information when it is related in some way to ourselves, the recall rate can be improved</p><p id=""><strong id="">Source Confusion</strong></p><p id="">A type of memory error where we don't remember where certain memories come from</p><p id="">Dangerous because when we disassociate the content of our knowledge from the source, we become similarly confident in all content despite not being confident in all sources</p><p id=""><strong id="">Suffix effect</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to be unable to recall the final items from a spoken list when the list is followed by an unnecessary or irrelevant speech item or suffix</p><p id="">Occurs because the mind fixates on the very end of the list, even if it's not actually part of the list</p><p id=""><strong id="">Spacing effect</strong></p><p id="">The tendency for learning to be more effective when study sessions are spaced out</p><p id="">Explains why cramming doesn't lead to long-term memory retention, and why repeated exposure over a longer period of time typically does</p><p id=""><strong id="">Telescoping effect</strong></p><p id="">Refers to inaccurate perceptions regarding time, where people see recent events as more remote than they are (backward telescoping), and remote events as more recent (forward telescoping)</p><p id="">Can occur whenever we make temporal assumptions regarding past events</p><p id=""><strong id="">Testing effect</strong></p><p id="">The tendency for long-term memory to be increased when some of the learning period is devoted to retrieving information from memory—in other words, devoted to 'active recall'</p><p id="">Flashcard software like Anki is an application of this</p><p id=""><strong id="">Tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon</strong></p><p id="">The experience of feeling confident that one knows an answer, yet is unable to produce the word</p><p id="">The effect tends to develop with age, but can be mitigated through diet, exercise, socialisation, and games related to words such as scrabble</p><p id=""><strong id="">Verbatim effect</strong></p><p id="">People remember the gist of information, which is its general meaning, better than they remember its exact form</p><p id="">This has important implications for presenting information. We should preference storytelling over facts or statistics, they'll stick better</p><p id=""><strong id="">Von Restorff effect</strong></p><p id="">An item that “stands out like a sore thumb” is more likely to be remembered or preferenced than other items</p><p id="">Takeaway: Make important information visually distinctive</p><p id=""><strong id="">Subselves</strong></p><p id="">We use different mental processes in different situations, so each of us is not a single character but a collection of different characters, who take turns to commandeer the mind depending on the situation. There is a work “you”, a friend “you”, an online “you”, etc.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Nudging</strong></p><p id="">The tendency for positive reinforcement or indirect suggestions to influence behaviour and decision-making</p><p id="">A 'nudge' makes it more likely that an individual will make a particular choice, or behave in a particular way; be wary of what or who is nudging you</p><p id=""><strong id="">Clanning</strong></p><p id="">The tendency of humans group naturally around important issues, positions, or events</p><p id="">Understand the group dynamic, or you’re likely to be caught up in it</p><p id=""><strong id="">Meehl Pattern</strong></p><p id="">When an expert in a field tries to predict something complicated but has a lower success rate doing so than a simple statistical formula (or ‘algorithm’)</p><p id="">Sometimes experts overcomplicate explanations instead of relying on simple data (The Curse of Knowledge)</p><p id=""><strong id="">Thousands of You</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to assume that we're one person in everyone else's mind when in reality, a different version of us exists in the minds of everyone who knows us</p><p id="">The person you think of as "yourself" exists only for you, and even you don't really know who that is</p><p id=""><strong id="">Asch Negative</strong></p><p id="">A theory explaining social conformity</p><p id="">If someone is Asch positive, they follow the crowd over what they believe to be true</p><p id="">If someone is Asch negative, they follow what they believe to be true regardless of the crowd's opinion</p><p id=""><strong id="">Enantiodromia</strong></p><p id="">An excess of something can give rise to its opposite. Excess builds up tension, and the more extreme the position, the more easily it can shift to its opposite</p><p id="">E.g. A society that is too liberal will be tolerant of tyrants, who will eventually make it illiberal</p><p id=""><strong id="">Protect Yourself From Bad Advice</strong></p><p id="">People tend to be most motivated by incentives. "Show me the incentives, and I'll show you the outcome."</p><p id="">When receiving advice from someone—a salesman, colleague, or even acquaintances—always remember what the adviser's personal incentives are</p><p id=""><strong id="">Influence Yourself</strong></p><p id="">A follow-on from the above: If you can determine the specific incentives that motivate you the most, you can hack your own motivation</p><p id="">Is it money? Status or prestige? Responsibility? Freedom? Whatever it is, figure it out and make them your main incentive</p><p id=""><strong id="">Doubt/Avoidance Tendency</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to make quick, poorly thought-out decisions during stressful situations</p><p id="">The pressure to remove doubt causes you to make ill-informed choices</p><p id="">Control by scheduling deliberate delays when stressed to strategize before reaching a decision</p><p id=""><strong id="">Ego Depletion</strong></p><p id="">The idea that willpower draws upon a limited pool of mental resources that can be used up</p><p id="">When the energy for mental activity is low, self-control is typically impaired, which would be considered a state of ego depletion</p><p id="">Minimise inconsequential decisions</p><p id=""><strong id="">Misattribution of Arousal</strong></p><p id="">People make mistakes in assuming what's causing them to feel aroused</p><p id="">For example, when actually experiencing physiological responses related to fear, people mislabel those responses as romantic arousal</p><p id="">Knowing the source of arousal is important</p><p id=""><strong id="">Illusion of Asymmetric Insight</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to feel like you know everyone else far better than they know you, and not only that, but you know them better than they know themselves</p><p id="">This illusion clouds your ability to see the people you disagree with as nuanced and complex</p><p id=""><strong id="">Enclothed Cognition</strong></p><p id="">The systematic influence that clothes have on our psychological processes</p><p id="">Clothing can enhance our psychological states, and it can improve our performance on tasks</p><p id="">Ask yourself, “Which clothing makes you feel [fierce, confident, composed, free…]?</p><p id=""><strong id="">Deindividuation</strong></p><p id="">A state when you become so immersed in the norms of the group that you lose your sense of identity and personal responsibility, which can ultimately lead to unsociable or "mob-like" behaviour</p><p id="">Anonymity and diffusion of responsibility act strongly here</p><p id=""><strong id="">Overjustification Effect</strong></p><p id="">A phenomenon in which getting paid for doing what you already enjoy will sometimes cause your love for the task to wane because you attribute your motivation as coming from the reward, not your internal feelings</p><p id=""><strong id="">Self-Enhancement Bias</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to protect unrealistic attitudes about your abilities in order to stay sane and avoid despair. Involves rating ourselves more highly than social norms would predict</p><p id=""><strong id="">Priming</strong></p><p id="">Every idea you experience now unconsciously influences all the ideas you experience later. Those ideas then influence your behavior without your realizing it</p><p id="">With awareness, we can remain conscious of how previous experiences may influence our present decision-making</p><p id=""><strong id="">Confabulation</strong></p><p id="">Confabulation is a type of memory error in which gaps in a person's memory are unconsciously filled with fabricated, misinterpreted, or distorted information</p><p id="">When someone confabulates, they are confusing things they have imagined with real memories</p><p id=""><strong id="">Procrastination</strong></p><p id="">The Myth: You procrastinate because you are lazy and can’t manage your time well</p><p id="">The Truth: Procrastination is fueled by weakness in the face of impulse and a failure to think about thinking</p><p id="">What's more important, your current impulses or your future life?</p><p id=""><strong id="">Introspection Illusion</strong></p><p id="">Believing you understand your motivations and desires, your likes and dislikes. You believe you know yourself and why you are the way you are</p><p id="">However, the truth is that when pressed to explain your emotional states, you'll typically make something up</p><p id=""><strong id="">Brand Loyalty</strong></p><p id="">A tendency to believe that you prefer the things you own over the things you don't because you made rational choices when you bought them</p><p id="">In reality, you prefer them because you rationalise your past choices to protect your sense of self</p><p id=""><strong id="">Argument from ignorance</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to decide something is true or false because you can't find evidence to the contrary. You don't know what the truth is, so you assume any explanation is as good as another</p><p id="">This makes us more likely to accept strange explanations</p><p id=""><strong id="">Cult Indoctrination</strong></p><p id="">The propensity for our innate human tendencies to make us susceptible to becoming part of a group that resembles a cult (or is a cult)</p><p id="">The term "cult" is hard to define, so we may fall into one without consciously knowing it</p><p id=""><strong id="">Supernormal Releasers</strong></p><p id="">If you associate something with survival, but find an example of that thing that is more perfect than anything your ancestors could have ever dreamed of—it will overstimulate you</p><p id="">Examples for humans are: junk food, the Internet, TV, and video games</p><p id=""><strong id="">Affect Heuristic</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to rely on our emotions, rather than concrete information, when making decisions</p><p id="">It allows us to reach a conclusion quickly and easily, but can also distort our thinking and lead us to make suboptimal choices</p><p id=""><strong id="">Selling Out</strong></p><p id="">Selling out is an expression for the compromising of a person's integrity in exchange for personal gain, such as money</p><p id="">This model reflects the idea that both consumerism and capitalism are driven by competition among consumers for status, rather than profit-seekers</p><p id=""><strong id="">Catharsis</strong></p><p id="">The tendency for "venting" (releasing strong emotions) to—counterintuitively—lead to sustained strong emotions and aggressive behaviour rather than relief from strong emotions</p><p id="">If you get accustomed to blowing off steam, you become dependent on it</p><p id=""><strong id="">Conformity</strong></p><p id="">The mistaken belief that we are strong individuals who don't conform unless forced to. In reality, it takes little more than an authority figure or social pressure for us to conform</p><p id="">Never be afraid to question authority when your actions could cause harm</p><p id=""><strong id="">Extinction Burst</strong></p><p id="">When your brain makes a last-ditch effort to return you to a bad habit after you quit it</p><p id="">To give up bad habits; overeating, smoking, or gambling, we must be prepared to look for alternative rewards or positive reinforcement, and we should expect resistance</p><p id=""><strong id="">Embodied Cognition</strong></p><p id="">Our physical settings prime us to see the world a certain way. We translate our physical worlds into words, and then believe those words</p><p id="">We believe our opinions of people and events are objective, but they are often influenced by the environment around us</p><p id=""><strong id="">Self-Handicapping</strong></p><p id="">Involves investments in a future reality in which you can blame your failure on something other than your ability</p><p id="">When the fear of failure is strong enough, we like to see new ways to blame possible failures on forces beyond our control to protect our egos</p><p id=""><strong id="">Self-Fulfilling Prophecies</strong></p><p id="">A positive outlook will lead to positive predictions, and you will start to unconsciously manipulate your behaviour and actions to deliver those predictions</p><p id="">Things you think are true will become reality if given enough time to fester</p><p id=""><strong id="">The Moment</strong></p><p id="">We believe we are one person, and our happiness is based on being content with our lives</p><p id="">In reality, we are multiple selves, and to be happy now and content later, we can't be focused only on reaching goals, because once we reach them, the experience ends</p><p id=""><strong id="">Caveman Syndrome</strong></p><p id="">Humans are optimized for a world that existed 100,000 years ago, not for the world today</p><p id="">Food is everywhere; predators are not</p><p id="">We use to be in constant motion; now we sit behind desks at a computer</p><p id="">Anxiety from overstimulation is rampant</p><p id="">How to counteract? 👇</p><p id=""><strong id="">Performance Requirements</strong></p><p id="">If you don’t give your body what it needs to run, you’ll won't function as well as you can</p><p id="">Basic tips:</p><ul id=""><li id="">Exercise regularly</li><li id="">Get enough sunlight</li><li id="">Eat high-quality food</li><li id="">Get at least 7-8 hours of sleep</li><li id="">Avoid social media at the start of your day</li></ul><p id=""><strong id="">The Onion Brain</strong></p><p id="">Our brains are made up of layers of internal voices that consistently change modes; excitement, concern, calmness</p><p id="">To be effective, we need to dissociate ourselves from the voices and realise that they are only an automatic reaction to our surrounding environment</p><p id=""><strong id="">Perceptual Control</strong></p><p id="">We act to keep our perception of the world within acceptable boundaries</p><p id="">Once a certain action brings our perception under control, we stop acting until the system is once again out of control</p><p id="">Control is about adjusting to environmental changes as they happen</p><p id=""><strong id="">Reference Level</strong></p><p id="">At the heart of every Perceptual Control system is a Reference Level-a range of perceptions that indicate the system is “under control”</p><p id="">When a perception is within the system’s reference level, nothing happens, when it isn't, change occurs</p><p id=""><strong id="">Conservation of Energy</strong></p><p id="">Humans have evolved to avoid expending energy unless it's necessary</p><p id="">Unless a Reference Level is violated, we'll "conserve energy" by not acting</p><p id="">Can explain why people stay in marginally satisfying jobs for decades, it's "good enough" but not great</p><p id=""><strong id="">Guiding Structure</strong></p><p id="">The structure of our environment is the largest determinant of our behavior</p><p id="">If you want to successfully change a behavior, change the structure that influences or supports the behavior first, and the behavior will follow—don't rely on willpower alone</p><p id=""><strong id="">Reorganization</strong></p><p id="">Occurs when a Reference Level is violated, but you don’t know how to bring the system back under control</p><p id="">This is what happens when people feel “unhappy with their jobs”, or have the “quarter-life crisis”</p><p id="">There’s something wrong, but it’s hard to know what</p><p id=""><strong id="">Conflict</strong></p><p id="">Occurs when two control systems try to change the same perception.
