This is world-class.”</p><p id="">But the fact remained, he would always push:</p><p id=""><strong id="">”Is this really the best that a five-year old could ever do?”</strong></p><p id="">A constant message—to give her best effort—that she could never quite escape.</p><p id="">After receiving a financial aid package to Yale, Miura-Ko was required to complete 10 hours of work study per week.</p><p id="">She found herself in the office of the Dean of Engineering.</p><p id="">The day before she goes to her first day of work, she calls her parents.</p><p id="">Her Dad gets on the phone and says, <strong id="">“Make sure you do a world-class job.”</strong></p><p id="">Ann responds, “I’m photocopying and filing. There’s no such thing as world-class there.”</p><p id="">And He says, “Well, I’d still think about it.”</p><p id="">So, on her first day, Ann finds herself standing in front of the photocopying machine with a stack of papers thinking:</p><p id="">”What is world-class in this situation?”</p><p id="">She decided it was photocopies where you couldn’t tell it was a photocopy—they would look like the originals.</p><p id="">Ann had many more menial tasks—like getting donuts for the office and labelling files—and every step of the way she would ask herself:</p><p id=""><strong id="">”What does world-class look like?”</strong></p><p id="">No matter how small or boring, she completed each task to the best of her ability without hesitation.</p><p id="">Ann continued this for two years, unnoticed, until one day...</p><p id="">The Dean of Engineering, Allan Bromley—a legendary physicist who’d worked under George Bush, Sr.—poked his head out of his office to see that his executive assistant was out.</p><p id="">He saw Ann and he said, “Who are you?”</p><p id="">She responded, “I’m Ann Miura. I’m your student assistant in this office.”</p><p id="">And he said, “Oh, I’ve heard of you. I need you to go and give my friend a tour of the engineering facilities.”</p><p id="">”I know you’ll do a good job. Sarah (the EA) has told me you’re great.”</p><p id="">So, Ann proceeds to take the friend on a tour of the engineering facilities.</p><p id="">They get along very well and discover that they both come from Palo Alto near San Francisco.</p><p id="">The friend stops in the middle of the conversation and asks, “Hey, what are you doing for spring break?”</p><p id="">Ann was planning on going back to Palo Alto.</p><p id="">”Well, that’s great, because I’m wondering if you want to come and shadow me and see what I do for a living?”</p><p id="">Ann realises she’s spent the whole conversation speaking about herself and hasn’t asked this guy what he did for a living.</p><p id="">So, she asks, “Well, what do you do for a living?”</p><p id="">The man responds, “I’m (Lew Platt) the CEO of Hewlett-Packard.”</p><p id="">Ann realises her mistake—doing what any junior would do in talking about themselves—but quickly responds:</p><p id="">“I think that would be amazing to shadow you.”</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640fab718b6f3dfe5dae6ce5_FSuRDuQWAAI1z-U.jpeg" id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p id="">So, that spring break, Ann joins Lew in his daily life as the CEO of HP.</p><p id="">They would drive around together, attend meetings together, and do all of the things that Lew had to do.</p><p id="">One day, Bill Gates came to make an announcement about .net with Hewlett-Packard.</p><p id="">Lew invited Ann to attend the meeting and see everything ‘backstage.’</p><p id="">He also invited the photographer in—which Ann didn’t think much of at the time—and he asked for a photo of Him and Ann talking to each other.</p><p id="">A few months later, after the fact, Ann receives some mail...</p><p id="">It’s a thank you letter that reads, “Thanks for coming to visit. I thought you would enjoy these photographs.”</p><p id="">The first photograph shows Ann and Lew sitting next to each other talking.</p><p id="">The second photograph shows Bill—sitting in the exact same seat as Ann was—talking to Lew.</p><p id="">Lew had tried to open Ann’s mind to the possibility that she could one day be sitting where Bill Gates was—she just had to see herself there first.</p><p id="">He saw something in Ann and said, “You know what? You have something and I see it. I’m going to show you something even greater.”</p><p id="">Ann recalls, “It was such a gift. It was so incredible because I hadn’t ever thought about my own personal potential ever.”</p><p id="">From that moment, a raft of new opportunities opened up for Ann including a mentorship with Lew Platt—CEO of HP.</p><p id="">Her career was officially launched.</p><p id="">But, it all comes back to one moment.</p><p id="">The moment that Allan Bromley—the Dean of Engineering—sticks his head out of his office needing an important job done.</p><p id="">He didn’t recognize Ann, but he knew her name.</p><p id="">More importantly, he knew that Ann was known for doing a great job.</p><p id="">It’s hard to find meaning in menial or boring tasks.</p><p id="">There’s often no immediate payoff that comes with them—like any good habit, there’s no immediate gratification.</p><p id="">We just want to get them done as quickly as possible so we can get on with the real, more interesting work.</p><p id="">But, this is a mistake.</p><p id="">Because how you do anything is how you do everything.</p><p id="">Your personal brand is the summation of the thousands of micro-acts you put in over the course of your career or life.</p><p id="">It’s what you do when no one is looking or expecting you to do a great job.</p><p id="">And the surest way in life to find luck is to make sure you give your very best in each and every one of those moments.</p><p id="">Because you never know what might be around the corner.</p><p id="">And you never know when doing your best will lead to a life-changing opportunity.</p><h2 id=""><strong id="">Remember:</strong></h2><p id="">Every day, you’re not just working for someone else.</p><p id="">You’re working for your future self.</p><p id="">You’re your own boss—the boss of the ‘luck’ that will eventually come your way.</p><p id="">Make the choice to increase your luck by being ‘world-class’ in everything you do.</p><p id="">If you want to dive deeper on Ann’s story, you can find the original conversation that <a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3R3aXR0ZXIuY29tL2FubmltYW5pYWMiLCJwb3N0X2lkIjoiNDkyYzA3NDQtY2Q2ZC00ZGNlLTg3MjItODRiYTQ4NjFiMGEwIiwicHVibGljYXRpb25faWQiOiIxMzdkNWU4My05NTAzLTRkYjctYThjNC1mMzQxNWMyMDU1YWUiLCJ2aXNpdF90b2tlbiI6IjdjYjdiN2U1LTkxMjUtNDQyZi1iOGI4LTI3Y2RjMTUyYWRiYiIsImlhdCI6MTY3ODcwNTYxNy4xNjQsImlzcyI6Im9yY2hpZCJ9.QCvvvnwnYRMarolJOZfpP5aBV-ycZblX_7wKvT39P_0" target="_blank" id="">@annimaniac</a> discusses this life-changing moment on the <a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3R3aXR0ZXIuY29tL3RmZXJyaXNzIiwicG9zdF9pZCI6IjQ5MmMwNzQ0LWNkNmQtNGRjZS04NzIyLTg0YmE0ODYxYjBhMCIsInB1YmxpY2F0aW9uX2lkIjoiMTM3ZDVlODMtOTUwMy00ZGI3LWE4YzQtZjM0MTVjMjA1NWFlIiwidmlzaXRfdG9rZW4iOiI3Y2I3YjdlNS05MTI1LTQ0MmYtYjhiOC0yN2NkYzE1MmFkYmIiLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzg3MDU2MTcuMTY3LCJpc3MiOiJvcmNoaWQifQ.H3T4qK5dcVx1wLQQGABaUZpzqRkINxWuJn8ymX7HFyo" target="_blank" id="">@tferriss</a> show:</p><p id=""><strong id="">Ann Miura-Ko — The Path from Shyness to World-Class Debater and Investor (#331)</strong></p><p id="">Photo: Christopher Michel (@chrismichel) “The main difference was that I was willing to outwork and outdo every competitor who walked in through that door.” — Ann Miura-Ko ...</p><p id="">tim.blog</p><h2 id="">That's it, I hope you enjoyed reading :)</h2><p>‍</p>
