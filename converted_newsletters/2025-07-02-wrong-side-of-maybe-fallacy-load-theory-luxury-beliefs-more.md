<p id="">Welcome to the new friends of the A Players newsletter who have joined us since last week!</p><h1 id="">This Week: 8 of the most interesting ideas I've found </h1><h2 id="">Wrong-Side-of-Maybe Fallacy</h2><p id="">People judge the same way: they look at which side of “maybe”—50%—the probability was on. </p><p id="">If the forecast said there was a 70% chance of rain and it rains, people think the forecast was right; if it doesn’t rain, they think it was wrong.</p><p id=""><a href="https://twitter.com/PTetlock" target="_blank" id="">@PTetlock</a></p><h2 id="">Load Theory</h2><p id="">The amount of attention you have remains constant. </p><p id="">It just gets used differently depending on the demands of your situation—and maybe not how you want it to be used. </p><p id="">When you become fatigued, it’s harder to place your attention where you want it. </p><p id="">h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/amishijha" target="_blank" id="">@amishijha</a></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640d564605a67850d18ad82b_image.jpeg" id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2 id="">Luxury Beliefs</h2><p id="">There’s increasingly less status attached to luxury goods, so cultural elites signal status with luxury beliefs. </p><p id="">These are ideas and opinions that confer status on the rich at very little cost while taking a toll on the lower class. </p><p id="">h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/robkhenderson" target="_blank" id="">@robkhenderson</a></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640d564605a6789caf8ad82c_image.jpeg" id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2 id="">Backwards Law</h2><p id="">The more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become, as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place.</p><p id="">Wanting what you have is as good as having what you want. </p><p id="">—Alan Watts</p><h2 id="">Bulverism</h2><p id="">Assuming someone is wrong because of the person’s motives, social identity, or personal characteristics. </p><p id="">“You’re only saying that because you’re a _____.”</p><p id="">Remember: Show that someone is wrong before you explain why they’re wrong.</p><h2 id="">Necessity &amp; Sufficiency</h2><p id="">A necessity is something you must have to achieve an outcome. </p><p id="">Sufficiency is what you actually need to achieve the outcome. </p><p id="">Necessary conditions must be present, but on their own, aren’t enough for achievement.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640d564605a67855598ad82d_image.jpeg" id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2 id="">The Toxoplasma of Rage</h2><p id="">The ideas that spread furthest are the most controversial ideas; not universally agreed upon ideas. </p><p id="">We see controversial ideas as an opportunity to signal our commitment to a tribe or stand out from others. </p><p id="">h/t&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/slatestarcodex" target="_blank" id="">@slatestarcodex</a></p><h2 id="">Cultural Parasitism</h2><p id="">When an idealogy parasitizes the mind and changes a person's behavior. </p><p id="">The person then passes the idealogy onto others, not because it’s true, but because it’s easily transmitted and believed. </p><p id="">Beware of that which is easily believable but ideological.</p><p id="">There you have it, 8 of the most interesting ideas I've found this week.</p><p id="">I hope you found these provocative.</p><p id="">Stay curious, </p><p id="">Alex</p><p id="">P.S. — If you're looking for a new gig, I might be able to help!</p><p id="">I've recently started an application-only talent collective to help you find your next big play.&nbsp;</p><p id="">Members of the A Players Talent Collective get warm intros to companies vetted by me—including Figma, Stripe, Coinbase, Brex, Peloton, Affirm, Amazon, Paypal, and many more.&nbsp;</p><p id="">It's completely free for candidates.
