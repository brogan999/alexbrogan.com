Learning SelectionHave you ever started learning something only to stop a few days or weeks later?\nThis can happen for lots of reasons, but often it's bad learning selection.\nSelecting what you learn and when you learn it is crucial to maintaining motivation to finish it.\nHere are some questions to make sure you're choosing well:\n1/ Is there a need for me to learn this skill/topic? If so, what is it?\n2/ How urgent is this need?\n3/ Is this the right time to be learning it?\n4/ Why will I stick with this project when it gets hard?\n5/ Is there a practical use for this learning? Can I use it in my current job?\n6/ Would I learn this if no one ever knew that I learnt it?\nWhen we have a clear \"why\" for learning something, it's easier to remain focused and resilient when it gets difficult.\nChoosing a project you'll stick with long enough is an underappreciated factor in learning.\nIf you switch from project to project, you'll never see the benefit of compounding in any one area.\nFocus is key.\nOnce you've chosen your learning, it's time to deconstruct.\n2. DeconstructionEvery complex skill or topic is just a combination of different skills or topics, just as every hard problem is a combination of smaller problems.\nTherefore, one of the smartest ways to learn is to first deconstruct into smaller components.\nHow to Deconstruct\nStep 1: Find the approximate scope of the topic of knowledge / skill\nNote down what you need to learn:\n- Concepts\n- Facts/Key definitions\n- Examples or analogies\n- Procedures (if it's a skill)\nStep 2: Produce a checklist or mindmap of the required learning\nFinding the Scope of the Topic\n1. Desktop Search:\n- Mind maps\n- Blog posts\n- University curriculum\n- Reddit or other online forums\n- Table of contents in textbooks\n2. Expert Interview:\n- Find an expert or someone in your network and ask them what you should be learning\n3. Selection/CompressionHere is where you ask:\n1. Which 20% of the blocks (concepts, facts, procedures) should I focus on for 80% or more of the outcome I want?\n2. What would I learn if I only had 2 weeks to learn?\nFocus on the highest value knowledge first.\n4. SequencingNow ask:\n1. In what order should I learn the blocks?\n2. What is the best logical progression of learning?\n3. What are the pre-requisites I need to be able to learn and do before the next step?\nWalk before you run.\n5. ResourcesIn the deconstruct step, you would have found multiple helpful sources that you can use to go deeper.\nNow is the time to select which ones you'll use for your learning.\nNote down what you'll use:\n- Books\n- Videos\n- Podcasts\n- Courses\n- Coaches, etc.\nBonus tip: if you know your learning style, you should preference using resources that align with that learning style.\nLearning styles (VARK Model): Visual, Auditory, Read/Write, Kinaesthetic.\n6. ScheduleHere's where you make it concrete and ask:\n1. When do I want to complete this learning project?\n2. How many hours will I commit per week?\n3. When am I committing these hours?\nPlace the details in your calendar, set reminders, and make it easy for yourself.\n7. Stakes/IncentivesHere's where you failure proof your commitment to learning.\nAsk:\n1. How can I set up real consequences to guarantee that I follow my learning project?\n2. How can I failure proof my decision?\nA goal without real consequences is wishful thinking.\nNow it's time to execute.\nI've previously covered 13 powerful learning techniques for the actual learning component.\nYou can dive in here:\nFor more on learning intelligently, these are the best resources I've found:\nThe First 20 Hours: How to Learn Anything...Fast -Josh Kaufman\nThe 4-Hour Chef - Tim Ferriss\nUltralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career - Scott Young\n","wordCount":"680","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-07-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-07-02T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://alexbrogan.com/articles/2025-07-02-a-system-for-learning-intelligently/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Alex Brogan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://alexbrogan.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://alexbrogan.com/ accesskey=h title="Alex Brogan (Alt + H)">Alex Brogan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
