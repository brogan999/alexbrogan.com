Ask for what you want in an assertive manner, just make sure you have the runs on the board. Know your worth. 
2. Be unreasonably interested in other people when you are meeting and getting to know them. Ask questions, be attentive and engaged. Just make sure it doesn’t become an interrogation. 
3. Don’t take things personally, unless of course someone has deliberately set out to get you. There are a myriad of reasons why people can act in a way that negatively affects you. It’s not always a personal attack. In most cases, what’s happening in someone else’s life is far more important to them and will determine their actions

It's not altruistic.
Nothing else can so quickly accelerate your career and improve your quality of life.
Being helpful is the best form of "self-promotion" there is.
When you see someone you'd rather not spend time talking to, think "help this person."
Instead of giving short answers and trying to end the conversation abruptly, genuinely ask how they are and what they're working on.

Here’s how you can do it intelligently.
1. Learning SelectionHave you ever started learning something only to stop a few days or weeks later?
This can happen for lots of reasons, but often it's bad learning selection.
Selecting what you learn and when you learn it is crucial to maintaining motivation to finish it.

We can’t skip them, so instead, we must learn to navigate them positively. To tackle uncomfortable conversations, we need to first use an integrative mindset, which allows us to adapt and remain neutral when faced with difficulty. Acknowledging our own discomforts, managing our emotions, and adjusting our communication approach is key to handling difficult conversations with ease. Next time you have a difficult conversation, focus on your goals and intentions. When we master difficult conversations, we command respect from our peers, gain confidence, and, most importantly, get what we want. Throughout my early career, I struggled to engage in difficult conversations, especially those that stretched my comfort zone, involved crucial feedback, or addressed poor performance either from myself or others. ...</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2025-07-02 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 2, 2025</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to How To Master Uncomfortable Conversations" href=https://alexbrogan.com/articles/2025-07-02-how-to-master-uncomfortable-conversations/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>The Crow and the Pitcher by Aesop</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>“On a hot summer day, a thirsty crow flew around searching for water.

As he crossed a narrow footbridge, he happened to look down and saw himself reflected in the quiet water as if in a mirror. But the greedy Dog thought he saw a real Dog carrying a bone much bigger than his own.
If he had stopped to think he would have known better. But instead of thinking, he dropped his bone and sprang at the Dog in the river, only to find himself swimming for dear life to reach the shore. At last he managed to scramble out, and as he stood sadly thinking about the good bone he had lost, he realized what a stupid Dog he had been.
