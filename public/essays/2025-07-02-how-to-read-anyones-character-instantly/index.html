It’s rarely a surprise to find those with the highest levels of resilience as those who have endured the most heartache in their upbringing.\n(5) Observe Their Calendar \u0026 Spending\nHow someone spends their time and money reveals explicitly what they value. “Show me your calendar and I’ll show you your future.” Actions—or the flow of time and money—reveal what a person is far better than words.\n(6) Observe Their Talk-To-Listen Ratio\nIn a social setting, someone can talk with others, listen, or avoid others. Listeners are rare, valuable, and effective. Exceptional listening correlates strongly with self-awareness, and self-awareness is a key indicator of character.\n(7) Observe The Small Things\nThis is a universal rule that many must learn the hard way. People who are dishonest in small things will be dishonest in big things as well. The little actions and words that people make tell you a lot about how they act and what they think.\n(8) Observe Them Around Friends\nPeople often reveal their true selves when they’re comfortable around friends. Watch how they treat others, especially those who can’t benefit them. Do they gossip or speak kindly about others? Are they supportive or competitive with their friends?\n(9) Observe Their Reaction to Stress\nStress brings out people’s core nature. Notice how they handle unexpected challenges or setbacks. Do they remain calm and composed, or do they lash out? Their stress response can reveal much about their emotional intelligence and resilience.\n(10) Observe Their Consistency\nActions speak louder than words, but consistent actions speak the loudest. Pay attention to whether someone’s behavior aligns with their stated values and beliefs over time. Consistency between words and actions is a strong indicator of integrity and reliability. Those who consistently follow through on their commitments, even when it’s inconvenient, demonstrate dependability and strength.\n","wordCount":"453","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-07-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-07-02T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-how-to-read-anyones-character-instantly/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Alex Brogan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://alexbrogan.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://alexbrogan.com/ accesskey=h title="Alex Brogan (Alt + H)">Alex Brogan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
