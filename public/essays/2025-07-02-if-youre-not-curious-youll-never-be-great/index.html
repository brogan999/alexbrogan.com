No matter what I try, I just can’t get myself to consume the content. It won’t stick. I feel bored. I reason that it’s because I’ve got so much else on my plate, and I’m too tired for extra learning.\n‍\nI didn’t realise it at the time, but this was the first clue I would never stay at Goldman. As time passes, my disillusionment grows. I'm grappling with a perplexing question: Why am I not thrilled to be here after working so hard to secure this coveted position? What's wrong with me?\n‍\nAfter months of pondering whether to stay or leave, the insight hits me: I’m not curious to learn Investment Banking, so I’ll never be great.

Over time, you’ll be more successful doing something you want to improve at—something that doesn’t feel like a chore. What others do effortlessly is often because they enjoy it. You can’t compete with someone doing something they’re genuinely excited by. The goal is to find what that thing is for you. Anything less sets you up to underachieve your potential.\n‍\nTakeaway 2: What’s best for you is best for the world.\nAbraham Maslow said that a key to self-actualisation is finding something to apply yourself to make the most of your abilities. Mark Twain said, “The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.” The greatest shame is that most humans never find out why they are born. But the world benefits when they do. The world benefits when each individual is put to their highest and best use. This is egotistical utilitarianism. The idea that what’s best for you is best for the world. Don’t do the world a disservice. Step back and ask what excites you and do that. The whole world benefits when you maximise your potential.\n‍\nIn a world where you can create huge businesses in any niche, you’re capping your potential and future success by not doing what you enjoy most.\n‍\n\"The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.\" — Mark Twain\n","wordCount":"538","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-07-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-07-02T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-if-youre-not-curious-youll-never-be-great/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Alex Brogan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://alexbrogan.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://alexbrogan.com/ accesskey=h title="Alex Brogan (Alt + H)">Alex Brogan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
