This may also have profound implications for the USD as the global reserve currency, potentially impacting the United States’ soft power and most certainly ability to manage debtWe could also see a new global currency created as a result of the changing formation of global financial powerA growing middle class across India, South East Asia, and Africa will create a second wind to globalisation, with demand for products and services growing exponentiallyHalf of America's shopping malls will close as a result of changing retail dynamics, including online retail penetration and low-cost last mile delivery (including drones)This will be a net positive as the stock is converted to housing, helping ease the housing affordability crisesHouse prices in the UK will become so unaffordable that the majority of people are forced to take rented accommodationChina will begin the first global experiment (as a result of automation and aging population) with Universal Basic Income funded primarily through the portion of business revenue generated through industrial, commercial, and agricultural automationOther developed world economies, like the US, will start to implement Universal Basic Income‍\nCulture\nDepression will overtake heart disease to become the worlds leading global disease burden (years lived in a state of poor health and years lost due to premature death)Junk food/soda/meat/diary will begin to drastically decline as the world shifts to healthier and plant-based alternativesWe will have another global pandemic, this time 5x more lethal than COVID-19Polyamorous relationships will begin to become more acceptedSexual relationships with robots will become commonplace‍\nTechnology\nSmart toilets equipped with health monitoring technology will become commonplace, leading to significant advances in personal health awareness and societal dynamicsRecreational marijuana will become legal in all 50 US States and half of all foreign countriesForest fires will be reduces to less than 5% of current levels using infrared drone monitoringAt least 5 moon bases will be established as scientific outpostsCybersecurity threats will escalate significantly, with advanced autonomous malwareResidential Realtors will go the way of travel agents and video storesThe number of service robots worldwide will reach 1 billionEctogenesis – the growth of mammalian embryos in artificial environments — will become mainstream and help the world arrest the drastic decline in birthratesChocolate will becoming an increasingly rare luxury with pricing soaring as a result of drought, soil depletion, and diminishing harvests in Africa (responsible for two-thirds of the world’s cocoa production)Stem cell pharmacies will be a fairly common experience in the developed worldEducation will be the killer app for VR. VR and machine learning will open new doors to enhancing the learning experience by introducing immersive environments that enable reusable and cognitively easy ways of digesting content. ML tools allow for more efficient utilization of VR—and augmented reality—for both teaching and learning, by providing insights into difficult topics, and by observing and analyzing the learning process for each individual (e.g. recommender systems for learning). Competition among educational institutions increases as a global market for delivering more sophisticated training resources grows. University campuses start to become a fashion of the past and educational certification (diplomas, etc.) is starting to be replaced by gamified VR/AR tests that bigger organizations will develop internally or with specialised vendors, under stringent confidentiality agreements.Synthetic biology will begin to revolutionise food production and healthcareAugmented reality and mixed reality will become as common as smartphonesOver 50% of traditional colleges will have collapsed, and micro colleges will emerge, requiring less than six months of training and apprenticeship to switch professionsOver 10% of all global transactions will be conducted via cryptocurrenciesSpace tourism will become a reality with regular flights to space hotelsOver 20% of all new construction will be 3D printed buildingNext-generation search engines are expected to integrate the physical world into their functionalitiesHuman cognitive capacities will begin to be augmented through nonbiological technology (BCI)Digital simulations will have entirely replaced traditional clinical trials for drug developmentDecentralized 3D printing will revolutionise manufacturing and reduce global emissionsQuantum computing will become mainstream, with far-reaching implications including the ability to explore frontiers in mathematics and particle physics and widespread security concerns‍\nBy 2040‍\nGeopolitics\nThe European Union will diverge into a core and periphery as a result of the one-size fits all currency not suiting the economic prosperity of all nations‍\nEconomy\nIndia will become the world’s third largest economy (alongside its status as the largest populous) leading to it becoming a true 3rd superpower‍\nCulture\nVirtual travel is expected to become a mainstream alternative to physical tourismIndividuals will become far more comfortable providing data provided it is used for positive means (like healthcare) and not just being shown advertisements or being the productThe institution of marriage will decline to 30% of the married populationIndustralised animal agriculture will be largely replaced by plant-based and cultured meat alternatives‍\nTechnology\nAutonomous vehicles will make up 100% of new global car productionReliable prevention and treatment of nearly all naturally occurring infectious diseasesCancer death rates will decline significantly, leading to the potential elimination of most cancerGenetic disease prevention and cure through advanced embryo screening and gene editing technologies will become mainstreamGenetic prevention of mental illness through embryo screening will become possible3D printed drugs will become realityManufacturing jobs will be virtually extinctHolographic telepresence will be possibleEpigenetic rejuvenation therapies will be accessible, allowing humans to begin reversing the aging processEV market share will approach 100% in all major countriesDynamic clothing will be introduced: almost any of its characteristics -
