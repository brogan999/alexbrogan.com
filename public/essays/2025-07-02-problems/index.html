Only 1% of Earth's water is available for use. In the western US, reservoirs are at record low levels. Rising temperatures and declining runoff are worsening the situation.

And it’s not just the factories; over 100,000 ships contribute significantly. These ships can emit as much as 5,000 tons of sulfur each year, equal to 50 million cars. This is a problem that affects everyone.</p><p id="">The causes are multifaceted: industrial emissions, shipping pollution, and insufficient regulations.

The global energy market is worth over $6 trillion. Yet, we still rely heavily on fossil fuels. The transition is slow, hampered by outdated regulations and entrenched interests.</p><p id="">Current efforts, like solar and battery commodification, are promising but insufficient.

Brands struggle to quantify why they need influencers. They often do it because others do. Marketers see it as a brand awareness play, not a measurable channel. The problem? Finding the right influencers is tough. Only 39% of marketers are happy with their matches.</p><p id="">The size of the issue is substantial. Billions are spent on influencer campaigns annually, yet measurement remains elusive. Current efforts to fix this?

In finance, a Bloomberg Terminal provides immediate insights. But for other sectors, the data landscape is fractured. For example, understanding how (the very high) life expectancy in Hong Kong correlates to other factors requires in-depth, structured data that is not readily available.</p><p id="">Current efforts are scattered. Companies are trying to create data repositories, but they often lack the breadth and structure needed. Many startups aim to fill this gap, but they face challenges in aggregation and validation.</p><p id="">The rise of AI and machine learning has increased the demand for structured data. Companies need accurate data to train models effectively. Regulatory changes around data privacy also create a need for better data management solutions.</p><p id="">Further reading:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/12/work-on-these-things.html" id="">Tyler Cowen</a></li></ul><p id="">‍</p><h5 id="">Left-handed people</h5><p id="">About 10-15% of the global population is left-handed, equating to over a billion individuals. Studies indicate that left-handed individuals generally earn less. This status discrepancy is a pressing issue.</p><p id="">Most products are designed for right-handers,<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-common-devices-that-left-handed-people-have-trouble-using" id=""> leaving left-handed people to struggle with tools</a> and technologies that don’t cater to their needs.</p><p id="">Further reading:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_against_left-handed_people" id="">Bias against left-handed people</a></li><li id=""><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/why-the-world-is-not-designed-for-left-handed-people-96bb5cf4c460" id="">Why the world is not designed for left-handed people</a></li></ul><p id="">‍</p><h5 id="">We need to fix mainstream media to focus more on important causes (and truth)(read: problems in society)</h5><p id="">The problem is clear: mainstream media has lost its way. Trust in news organizations is plummeting. In 2021, only 58% of Americans trusted national news. This is a 35% drop among Republicans since 2016. The decline in journalism is staggering. From 114,000 newsroom employees in 2008 to just 85,000 in 2020—a 26% drop.</p><p id="">Why is this happening? The rise of social media and digital advertising is a major factor. Platforms like Facebook and Google have siphoned off revenue, leaving traditional media struggling. In 2008, U.S. newspapers earned $38 billion in ad revenue; by 2020, that number had fallen to below $9 billion. Emotion-driven clickbait dominates the landscape. Anger and sensationalism generate clicks, and falsehoods spread six times faster than the truth on Twitter.</p><p id="">Current efforts to combat these issues include fact-checking initiatives and calls for media literacy. However, these alone won't solve the systemic problems.</p><p id="">Further reading:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/preventing-the-spread-of-false-ideas-on-social-media/" id="">80000hours: preventing the spread of false ideas on social media</a></li><li id=""><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/world/democracy-media-challenges.html" id="">NYTimes: Can Mainstream Media Save Itself</a></li></ul><p id="">‍</p><h1 id="">Cybersecurity</h1><p>‍</p><h5 id="">Online scamming is growing exponentially</h5><p id="">It's estimated that scams cost U.S. consumers about $3.3 billion in 2020 alone.

The ability to manipulate matter at the atomic level could revolutionize industries but also create existential risks. The stakes are high. If we can produce anything, including weapons, it raises concerns about proliferation. Estimates suggest there's a 4–5% chance that advanced nanotechnology will be realized by 2040.

R&amp;D spending in the U.S. dropped from 69% to 30% of the global total. That's a significant shift. China’s economic influence is growing. It's now the largest trading partner for more countries than the U.S. This is fueled by initiatives like the Belt and Road.</p><p id="">The U.S. dollar still holds strong, representing nearly 60% of global reserves. But military spending doesn’t equate to effectiveness.

Yet, geopolitical tensions are reshaping the landscape. TSMC is expanding production to Arizona, investing $40 billion, which could raise manufacturing costs by 55% in the U.S. This shift threatens Taiwan's dominance.</p><p id="">The root causes include the U.S.-China rivalry, COVID-19 disruptions, and the war in Ukraine. Governments are now prioritizing local supply chains for critical tech, leading to a brain drain of talent from Taiwan to China. The CHIPS Act in the U.S. aims to incentivize domestic production but comes with high costs and risks.</p><p id="">Further reading:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_War:_The_Fight_for_the_World%27s_Most_Critical_Technology" id="">Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology</a></li><li id=""><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/taiwan-makes-the-majority-of-the-worlds-computer-chips-now-its-running-out-of-electricity/" id="">Wired: Taiwan Makes the Majority of the World’s Computer Chips.

Since 1980, college costs have surged 169%, while young workers' earnings rose only 19%. Today, two-thirds of jobs require a degree, but many young adults live at home—over 50% of 18- to 29-year-olds. This is a crisis of social mobility.</p><p id="">The causes?

If just a fraction of that could pivot to discovery-driven commerce, the potential is immense.</p><p id="">The causes are multifaceted. Online shopping is efficient but lacks the emotional engagement found in physical retail. People crave social interactions and recommendations when shopping. Current efforts are emerging.
