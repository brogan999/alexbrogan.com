And it’s not just the factories; over 100,000 ships contribute significantly. These ships can emit as much as 5,000 tons of sulfur each year, equal to 50 million cars. This is a problem that affects everyone.\nThe causes are multifaceted: industrial emissions, shipping pollution, and insufficient regulations. Current efforts focus on cleaner fuels and technologies, but they are not enough.\nFurther reading:\nState of Global AirWHO: global air quality guidelines‍\nThere's not enough coordination on climate change and transitioning to new energy sourcesThe coordination on climate change and energy transition is woefully inadequate. The global energy market is worth over $6 trillion. Yet, we still rely heavily on fossil fuels. The transition is slow, hampered by outdated regulations and entrenched interests.\nCurrent efforts, like solar and battery commodification, are promising but insufficient. Companies are experimenting, but their solutions often lack scalability.\nFurther reading:\nThe Climate Action TrackerUNFCCC: Global Climate Action‍\nRebrand nuclearDespite being carbon-free, its public perception is poor. Historical accidents have created fear. In the U.S., about 20% of energy comes from nuclear, but it could be much higher. The key issue is education.

Brands struggle to quantify why they need influencers. They often do it because others do. Marketers see it as a brand awareness play, not a measurable channel. The problem? Finding the right influencers is tough. Only 39% of marketers are happy with their matches.\nThe size of the issue is substantial. Billions are spent on influencer campaigns annually, yet measurement remains elusive. Current efforts to fix this? Tools exist for finding and managing influencers, but they don't solve the core problem.\nFurther reading:\n17000credits: Influencer Marketing is broken‍\nWe need a bloomberg terminal for everythingData is crucial, yet access is limited. In finance, a Bloomberg Terminal provides immediate insights. But for other sectors, the data landscape is fractured. For example, understanding how (the very high) life expectancy in Hong Kong correlates to other factors requires in-depth, structured data that is not readily available.\nCurrent efforts are scattered. Companies are trying to create data repositories, but they often lack the breadth and structure needed. Many startups aim to fill this gap, but they face challenges in aggregation and validation.\nThe rise of AI and machine learning has increased the demand for structured data. Companies need accurate data to train models effectively. Regulatory changes around data privacy also create a need for better data management solutions.\nFurther reading:\nTyler Cowen‍\nLeft-handed peopleAbout 10-15% of the global population is left-handed, equating to over a billion individuals. Studies indicate that left-handed individuals generally earn less. This status discrepancy is a pressing issue.\nMost products are designed for right-handers, leaving left-handed people to struggle with tools and technologies that don’t cater to their needs.\nFurther reading:\nBias against left-handed peopleWhy the world is not designed for left-handed people‍\nWe need to fix mainstream media to focus more on important causes (and truth)(read: problems in society)The problem is clear: mainstream media has lost its way. Trust in news organizations is plummeting. In 2021, only 58% of Americans trusted national news. This is a 35% drop among Republicans since 2016. The decline in journalism is staggering. From 114,000 newsroom employees in 2008 to just 85,000 in 2020—a 26% drop.\nWhy is this happening? The rise of social media and digital advertising is a major factor. Platforms like Facebook and Google have siphoned off revenue, leaving traditional media struggling. In 2008, U.S. newspapers earned $38 billion in ad revenue; by 2020, that number had fallen to below $9 billion. Emotion-driven clickbait dominates the landscape. Anger and sensationalism generate clicks, and falsehoods spread six times faster than the truth on Twitter.\nCurrent efforts to combat these issues include fact-checking initiatives and calls for media literacy. However, these alone won't solve the systemic problems.\nFurther reading:\n80000hours: preventing the spread of false ideas on social mediaNYTimes: Can Mainstream Media Save Itself‍\nCybersecurity‍\nOnline scamming is growing exponentiallyIt's estimated that scams cost U.S. consumers about $3.3 billion in 2020 alone. The rise of technology, especially AI, has made it easier for scammers to operate. Current efforts to combat this include better education for consumers and stronger regulations on tech companies.\nFurther reading:\nFuturism: Scammers figure out trick to steal houses using AINew Gmail Security Alert For 2.5 Billion Users As AI Hack ConfirmedFTC: FTC Issues Annual Report to Congress on Agency’s Actions to Protect Older Adults‍\nDefence‍\nRisks from atomically precise manufacturingAtomically precise manufacturing (APM) holds promise and peril. The ability to manipulate matter at the atomic level could revolutionize industries but also create existential risks. The stakes are high. If we can produce anything, including weapons, it raises concerns about proliferation. Estimates suggest there's a 4–5% chance that advanced nanotechnology will be realized by 2040. This technology could lead to a cheaper, faster manufacturing process, but it also carries significant risks.\nFurther reading:\n80000hours: atomically precise manufacturing‍\nChina's ascendanceChina's rise is a problem for the U.S. It's not just a matter of pride; it’s economic and strategic. R\u0026D spending in the U.S. dropped from 69% to 30% of the global total. That's a significant shift. China’s economic influence is growing. It's now the largest trading partner for more countries than the U.S. This is fueled by initiatives like the Belt and Road.\nThe U.S. dollar still holds strong, representing nearly 60% of global reserves. But military spending doesn’t equate to effectiveness. The U.S. outspends, but China’s dollar stretches further due to lower costs. Further reading:\nThe Economist: China is writing the world’s technology rulesLee Kuan Yew: The Grand Master's Insights on China, the United States, and the World‍\nSemiconductor manufacturing concentrationTaiwan accounts for over 60% of global semiconductor production and 90% of the most advanced chips. Yet, geopolitical tensions are reshaping the landscape. TSMC is expanding production to Arizona, investing $40 billion, which could raise manufacturing costs by 55% in the U.S. This shift threatens Taiwan's dominance.\nThe root causes include the U.S.-China rivalry, COVID-19 disruptions, and the war in Ukraine. Governments are now prioritizing local supply chains for critical tech, leading to a brain drain of talent from Taiwan to China. The CHIPS Act in the U.S. aims to incentivize domestic production but comes with high costs and risks.\nFurther reading:\nChip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical TechnologyWired: Taiwan Makes the Majority of the World’s Computer Chips. Now It’s Running Out of Electricity‍\nEducation‍\nCollege is the ticket to the middle class, but education is unaffordableCollege is critical for middle-class entry, yet it’s unaffordable. Since 1980, college costs have surged 169%, while young workers' earnings rose only 19%. Today, two-thirds of jobs require a degree, but many young adults live at home—over 50% of 18- to 29-year-olds. This is a crisis of social mobility.\nThe causes? Stagnant wages, rising education costs, and growing wealth inequality. Young people face insurmountable student debt, totaling $1.7 trillion, surpassing credit card debt.\nFurther reading:\nFREOPP: Higher Education: Making Education Beyond High School Work for AllWSJ: The Student-Debt Debacle‍\nE-Commerce‍\nWe need more efficient ways to repurpose ecommerce goods (resale)E-commerce goods need efficient repurposing. The market for recommerce is projected to hit USD 289 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 15.8%. This growth is driven by sustainability concerns, the cost-effectiveness of used goods, and a desire for unique items. Current efforts include companies like ThredUp and The RealReal, which focus on resale but are limited in scope.\nFurther reading:\nDigital Native: The 10 forces shaping commerceECOEnclose: Reverse Logistics Companies and Strategies: How to Optimize Your Return Process‍\nOverstock for retailersBrands produce over $500B worth of excess goods each year. Much of this ends up in landfills. The problem is not just in apparel; other categories, like beauty, see less than half of their inventory sold annually.\nThe causes are clear: overproduction, inefficient inventory management, and a lack of tech solutions. Current marketplaces to offload excess stock are outdated and inefficient. They rely heavily on human labor rather than software solutions.\nFurther reading:\nDigital Native: The 10 forces shaping commerceInventory Glut: Strategies and Insights for Modern Retailers‍\nNo one has figured out discovery driven shoppingDiscovery-driven shopping is uncharted territory. Amazon dominates with its search-driven model—buying rates soar to 74% for Prime members. Yet, there's a gap. No one has cracked the code for recreating the serendipity of browsing in physical stores. The e-commerce market is projected to exceed $6 trillion globally by 2024. If just a fraction of that could pivot to discovery-driven commerce, the potential is immense.\nThe causes are multifaceted. Online shopping is efficient but lacks the emotional engagement found in physical retail. People crave social interactions and recommendations when shopping. Current efforts are emerging. Companies like Flagship are pioneering creator-driven commerce, allowing individuals to curate their own online boutiques. This model has proven successful, with creators generating over $1 million in sales.\nFurther reading:\nInformation Discovery in e-Commerce‍\nFinance‍\nWe need better global redistribution of wealthWealth is still unevenly distributed globally. $5,000 can save a life, yet millions live on less than that. This suffering is preventable. Current efforts to redistribute wealth lack organization and scale.\nOver 700 million people live in extreme poverty. Many initiatives exist but need better funding and execution. Current efforts are piecemeal, driven by NGOs and charities, often without sustainable models.\nFurther reading:\nWe Need to Emphasise Equality, and so Redistribution, Rather than GrowthImaginary society gives window into support for wealth redistribution‍\nProviding more ownership to everyone in america is a powerful wealth building strategyThe top 10% own 89% of stocks. The wealthiest 1% control nearly half of all household stocks. This is a massive concentration of wealth. It’s growing because of policies that favor the rich, like lower capital gains taxes and mortgage interest deductions.\nThe problem is exacerbated by financialization. Financial assets to GDP peaked at 5.9:1 during the pandemic. Housing is becoming unaffordable. In 1970, it took 2.7 years of median income to buy a home. By 2020, that jumped to 5.6 years. This is a crisis of access and equity.\nCurrent efforts focus on enhancing stock market participation. Many companies are exploring ways to democratize access to assets. Yet, nearly half of U.S. households still don’t invest in stocks.\nFurther reading:\nSupporting Workers and Strengthening Communities Through Employee OwnershipTeamshares is one of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies in finance‍\nAccess to exclusive industries is tightly controlledMany exclusive industries—like Hollywood and Silicon Valley—require connections to get in. This limits the potential number of innovators. And considering that 98% of social value from innovations is passed to consumers, this is a huge loss for society. If more people had access, more people could innovate.\nY Combinator is an example of a company that’s democratised access to venture capital. But we need more.\nFurther reading:\nNeil Thanedar: The Front Door‍\nGovernment/Politics‍\nGovernments aren't measuring their own effectivenessGovernments are failing to measure their own effectiveness. This is a huge oversight. Take the CDC, receiving just 1% of the defense budget, while public health infrastructure crumbled during the pandemic. The Department of Agriculture has a budget of $150 billion. How effective is it? No one knows, and that’s a problem.\nThe size of the issue is staggering. Billions go unaccounted for in government spending. Yet, there's little scrutiny. Current efforts to address this lack of institutional criticism are minimal. We see tons of corporate and policy criticism, but government departments remain largely unexamined.\nFurther reading:\nImproving decision making (especially in important institutions)Challenges in Government Spend Control. A Guide for Financial Controllers‍\nWe need more high-leverage ways to speed up economic growthIn the U.S., GDP growth has averaged just 2% over the last decade. That’s not enough to lift living standards significantly. The causes are complex: regulatory burdens, inefficient institutions, and lack of innovation.\nFurther reading:\nHigh-leverage ways to speed up economic growth‍\nChanging sentiments on the role of governmentTrust in government is eroding. A significant shift occurred during the Reagan Revolution, where 60% of Americans believed government was a friend, but now that number has plummeted to about 30%. This shift has deep roots in political rhetoric, which increasingly frames government as an adversary rather than a partner.\nCauses are multifaceted. The rise of individualism, market-driven ideologies, and a cultural narrative that vilifies government play significant roles. The decline of community organizations further exacerbates this distrust. Further reading:\nAmericans’ Views of Government: Decades of Distrust, Enduring Support for Its RoleKey findings about Americans’ declining trust in government and each other‍\nThe IRS is overwhelmed, and it’s not helping the US debt positionAudits have plummeted from over 3% of tax returns in 1960 to less than 0.5% today. This means around $600 billion in taxes go unpaid every year. The wealthiest 1% account for 28% of that loss.\nThe complexity of the tax code is a big part of the problem. Loopholes abound, and tax “reform” has only made it worse. As a result, tax avoidance has become a strategy for the rich.\nCurrent efforts to fix this are inadequate. More audits would help, but the IRS lacks the resources. We need new technology to streamline filing and enforcement.\nFurther reading:\nEfforts to Curb Tax Avoidance Offshore Paid Off, to a Degree‍\nPolitics isn’t focused enough on solutionsPolitics is failing to deliver solutions. It’s entangled in conflicts over blame rather than focusing on fixing problems. The U.S. government budget is over $6.55 trillion, dwarfing the combined net worth of the world’s top-10 billionaires, which sits at $1.15 trillion. This disparity highlights a significant issue: the sheer scale of government spending compared to the wealth of individuals. The government spending effectively really matters.\nThe causes are multifaceted. There’s a lack of optimization in spending, systemic inefficiencies, and a pervasive cynicism that deters engagement. Many assume all politicians are corrupt or that their votes don’t matter, leading to apathy.\nThere’s growing frustration with the status quo, increasing political polarization, and a surge in civic engagement driven by social media. Further reading:\nAmericans are NOT better off Now than they were under America First Policies‍\nDeclining infrastructure in the USThe U.S. infrastructure is in decline. Public spending on infrastructure has been stuck at 1.3% of GDP since 1983. One in five roads is in poor condition. Forty-five percent of Americans lack access to public transit. Water main breaks happen every two minutes.\nThis underinvestment is a problem. It leads to crises like the Flint water disaster and the Miami condo collapse. While the U.S. spends little, China invests ten times more in infrastructure. This disparity affects mobility and safety.\nFurther reading:\nAmerica's Infrastructure Scores a C-At its two-year anniversary, the bipartisan infrastructure law continues to rebuild all of America‍\nPrivatized R\u0026D = privatized progressFederal R\u0026D funding has dropped significantly, with private investment taking its place. From the 1960s to now, federal funding has decreased by nearly 30%. This shift is driven by market pressures that favor short-term results over long-term exploration.\nCurrent efforts to address this issue include pushing for increased government funding and public-private partnerships. However, these often fail to tackle the root cause: the prioritization of profit over public good.\nThe government has a critical role to play in funding specific-types of innovation that require long-term, patient capital and that cannot be solved by private markets due to the lack of a profit incentive. This isn’t happening on the scale it needs to. As a reminder, a non-exhaustive list of technologies the US government funded include:\nThe Internet, originally developed as ARPANET by DARPAGPS technology, developed by the Department of Defense ($5.6 billion investment from 1973-2000)Google’s initial algorithm, funded by NSF and CIA grantsTouch screen technology, developed through NSF fellowshipsSIRI voice activation system, funded by DARPA with $22 millionTesla’s early development (received $465 million government loan in 2009)Modern wind energy technology and turbines (DARPA)Self-driving car technology (DARPA initiative)Airbag technology (military and space research)Most innovative drugs and pharmaceuticals (NIH invested $792 billion from 1936-2011)MRI technologyKidney matching program algorithmsDNA amplification and biotechnology advancesMicrochips (originally for military missile targeting)Semiconductor technologyRadar systemsSpace exploration technologiesFurther reading:\nThe State of U.S. Science and Engineering 2024Historical Trends in Federal R\u0026D‍\nHealthcare‍\nThe rise of egg freezing / fertility crisisThe average age of first-time mothers is increasing, with significant implications. By 2040, over 20% of Americans will be seniors. This demographic shift isn't just about aging; it's about the delayed childbearing of women.\nCurrently, 30% annual growth in egg freezing cycles signals rising demand. Yet, the overall numbers are low, indicating a nascent market. The process remains complex and stigmatized, holding back wider adoption.\nIf you believe that family formation is critical to the stability of society and observe that marriages rates are falling (see below), this is a major problem.\nFurther reading:\nOn the Deepening Fertility CrisisImproving Health for Women by Better Supporting Them Through Pregnancy and Beyond‍\nFalling birthratesFalling birthrates are a significant issue. From 5.7 children per family in the past, we're down to 2.4 today. Italy shows even lower rates. This decline is alarming, as it threatens population sustainability.\nThe causes are multi-faceted. Economic pressures, changing social norms, and ineffective government incentives play a role. Current solutions are limited and often miss the mark.\nFurther reading:\nWhy Is Fertility Down, and What Can Be Done About It?The Lancet: Dramatic declines in global fertility rates set to transform global population patterns by 2100‍\nRising childcare costsIn the U.S., parents spend an average of $200 to $1,300 per month on childcare, depending on location and age group. This can consume nearly 20% of a family's income. The primary causes? Rising demand, stagnant wages, and insufficient state funding.\nCurrent efforts focus on subsidies and public programs, but they often fall short. The system is fragmented. There’s no one-size-fits-all solution, and many families are left to fend for themselves.\nThe financial cost is the largest determinant of the decision to have a child. Hence solving childcare costs is imperative for fixing our declining fertility rates.\nFurther reading:\nSpiking childcare costs are forcing many mothers to work fewer hours or none at allThe parental work disruption index: A new measure of the childcare crisisChild care costs are outpacing inflation: Report‍\nThe invisible epidemic: autoimmune diseaseAutoimmune diseases are a growing problem. They affect 1 in 10 people globally. In the U.S., around 50 million are affected, with women making up 75% of that number. The incidence of these diseases is rising by 3% to 9% annually. This is alarming.\nThe causes are multifaceted. Increased exposure to toxic chemicals and infections may play a role. Changing diets and lifestyles could be contributing factors as well. Current treatments exist but are limited. They manage symptoms rather than cure the diseases.\nFurther reading:\nNIH: Autoimmune DiseasesGarvan Institute: Autoimmune diseases‍\nThe hospital sector is going underwaterOver 34 million admissions a year across 6,100 hospitals, yet nearly 4% of the $300 billion in hospital bonds are struggling with payments. Debt-to-EBITDA ratios have surged to 3.9x, while bad debt has hit $50 billion, with 60 hospitals downgraded this year alone.\nThe causes are multifaceted: rising interest rates, low profit margins, increased labor costs, and a shift toward outpatient care models. The pandemic exacerbated these issues, leading to a historic reliance on federal support.\nCurrent efforts are underway to alleviate the strain. CMS proposed $9 billion in remediation payments and a 3.1% increase in outpatient reimbursements for 2024. However, the fundamental structure of the industry remains problematic, with inadequate reimbursement rates and high fixed costs.\nFurther reading:\nHospitals Face Financial Pressures as Costs of Caring Continue to SurgeThe top 5 financial challenges hospitals face in a post-pandemic world‍\nWomen's healthWomen make up over half the population, yet their health research is underfunded. For instance, diseases affecting women are often overlooked in favor of \"men’s diseases.\" This leads to a funding imbalance, where women's health research receives significantly less focus.\nOne in six North American women will require fertility treatments, which can cost between $20,000 and $40,000 per round. This is a staggering figure considering the financial strain it puts on families. The lack of investment in women’s health is primarily due to historical biases in medical research funding.\nFurther reading:\nWomen’s health research lacks funding – these charts show howFunding research on women’s health‍\nClinical trials in healthcare remain a bottleneck to scientific progressClinical trials face significant challenges. Less than 15% of patients know about potential trials. A fifth of enrolled participants drop out. This leads to delays and increased costs, hindering drug development.\nThe problem is sizable. Delayed trials can cost pharma companies millions. Efficient trials are essential. Current efforts include technologies like Medable, which optimizes protocols using historical data. Companies like Pluto Health and Mural Health aim to improve patient engagement and payment processes, respectively.\nFurther reading:\nTop 5 Challenges and Opportunities in Clinical Trials - PPD’s industry analysis‍\nHighly leveraged demographicsOver 100 million Americans are burdened with medical debt.

In low-income nations, only about $100 is spent on healthcare per person, compared to over $4,500 in the EU and nearly $11,000 in the US. This disparity creates immense opportunity for improvement.\nThe root causes are straightforward: inadequate funding, lack of infrastructure, and insufficient awareness. Current efforts focus on scaling up basic health treatments, mainly through NGOs and international organizations like the Gates Foundation.\nFurther reading:\nLancet Global Health: Bridging the global health gapNIH: The Root Causes of Health Inequity‍\nMental health is still neglectedEstimates suggest that around 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. experience mental illness each year. That's approximately 51.5 million people. Yet, funding and attention lag behind physical health.\nWhy? Mental health is complex. It’s harder to quantify. The stigma surrounding it complicates discussions and funding. Traditional healthcare systems focus predominantly on physical ailments.\nFurther reading:\nThe Federal and State Role in Mental Health - Comprehensive analysis of systemic issuesWe Cannot Continue to Neglect Mental Health Funding - In-depth look at funding disparities‍\nThe U.S. healthcare system is embarrassingly inefficientThe U.S. healthcare system is a mess.

Yet, our life expectancy lags behind many developed nations.\nThe root of the problem? Administrative bloat. Regulatory tasks consume a third of our healthcare spending. Patients avoid care due to high costs; 64% have delayed treatment. The top hospitals charge seven times the actual service cost.\nFurther reading:\nWaste in the US Health Care System - Estimated Costs and Potential for SavingsHealth Care in the U.S. Compared to Other High-Income Countries‍\nSafety in healthcareHealthcare safety is a significant issue. Hundreds of thousands die each year due to preventable mistakes and unsafe products. The FDA oversees countless products but is often slow to act. The current system is riddled with inefficiencies.\nThe market is vast. In the U.S. alone, healthcare spending surpassed $4 trillion in 2020. Consumers are increasingly aware of the dangers posed by unsafe products. The causes are multifaceted: regulatory lag, profit-driven motives, and outdated testing methods.\nFurther reading:\nRevisiting To Err Is Human 20 years laterAdvancing Patient Safety: Reviews From the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Making Healthcare Safer III Report‍\nHuman Augmentation‍\nImproving individual reasoning or cognitionA better decision-making process can lead to better outcomes. This is especially true for complex issues. Estimates suggest that enhancing cognitive abilities could lead to a 10-20% improvement in decision-making effectiveness in various fields.\nThe causes of this problem are multifaceted. Individuals often lack access to effective tools and training. There is also a lack of research into cognitive enhancement techniques. Current efforts include tools, trainings, and research into nootropics, which could be as impactful as global health interventions.\nFurther reading:\nPeople systematically overlook subtractive changesImproving individual reasoning or cognition‍\nWhole brain emulationWhole brain emulation (WBE) aims to replicate human brain functionality in software. This could create advanced AI, but it carries risks. The potential market for this technology is vast, as AI is projected to be a trillion-dollar industry by the end of the decade. Yet, the ethical implications are significant, making it a double-edged sword.\nThe problem stems from limitations in our understanding of consciousness and intelligence. Current AI lacks the nuanced reasoning of humans. Existing research focuses on simpler organisms, but human emulation is the end goal. Companies like OpenAI and DeepMind are advancing AI, but without WBE, they may never reach human-level reasoning.\nFurther reading:\nWhole Brain Emulation: A RoadmapWhole brain emulation‍\nHardware‍\nPower and cooling for data centersData centers are about to hit a wall. By 2030, they're projected to use 10% of the global power supply. That's more than Brazil. The AI boom is driving this demand, as training large models requires massive energy, especially with power-hungry GPUs.\nThe problem lies in limited access to energy and cooling. Builders are scrambling for efficient solutions. Alternatives like renewables and nuclear power are being explored, but lead times for cooling systems have ballooned to five times longer than before. Backup generators now take up to two years to deliver.\nCurrent efforts include Amazon's nuclear-powered data center and Meta's $800M investment in Texas. Companies like Standard Power are looking at modular nuclear reactors. But these solutions are still in early stages.\nFurther reading:\nOpportunities in Data Centers \u0026 Next-Gen NetworkingRecalibrating global data center energy-use estimates‍\nReal Estate‍\nAddressing the housing affordability crisisThe housing affordability crisis is severe. In 2020, the median home price reached over four times the median household income. This is a drastic increase from two and a half times in 1990. Younger generations struggle to buy homes, which undermines the American Dream.\nThe problem stems from policies that favor older generations. Tax benefits for mortgage interest help them, while younger people face high rents and stagnant wages.\nFurther reading:\nSolving America’s housing crisis means fixing the ‘ROI problem,’ says White House economistThe State of the Nation’s Housing 2023 - Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies‍\nScience‍\nGlobal research publishing needs reformingResearch publishing is broken. Each year, around $1 trillion is spent on research globally, yet 55% to 70% of research remains behind paywalls. Five major companies dominate the market, reaping $7 billion in revenue with profit margins higher than tech giants. The system prioritizes profit, not accessibility.\nThe causes are clear. Traditional journal structures are outdated. The pay-to-publish model favors wealthier institutions, excluding researchers in low- and middle-income countries. Current efforts, like Open Access initiatives, swap one problem for another, keeping the system profitable for publishers.\nFurther reading:\nThe $1 Trillion Paradox: Why Reforming Research Publishing Should Be a Global PriorityResearch Publishing Is an Under-Recognised Global ChallengeOpen access: The true cost of science publishing‍\nThere's a vast amount of knowledge about scientific progress that remains inaccessibleThere's a huge gap in accessible scientific knowledge. Estimates suggest that 70% of scientific research is locked away in inaccessible formats. This limits progress across fields. The causes are multiple: outdated publication models, lack of collaboration, and insufficient funding for knowledge dissemination.\nFurther reading:\nOpenness is an asset‍\nSMBs‍\nWe need to build a middle class for startupsStartups face a binary choice: bootstrap or raise massive VC funds. This creates a narrow view of success. Many aspiring entrepreneurs think they must choose one of these paths. The result? A lack of viable middle-ground options. In the U.S., there are 200,000 Mittelstands, generating over $10 trillion in annual revenue. However, many entrepreneurs struggle to find funding without giving up equity, resorting to risky loans or credit.\nVCs push founders to raise money too early. High-cost markets make it hard to bootstrap effectively. Many startups become dependent on funding, stalling their growth. Founders often get stuck on a fundraising treadmill, unable to pivot.\nThere are emerging non-dilutive funding sources, like Pipe and Stripe Capital, that allow businesses to grow without giving away equity. These options are changing the landscape for startups. Yet, the mindset around funding still largely favors venture capital routes.\nFurther reading:\nNeil Thanedar: We need a middle class for startups‍\nSocial Trends/Problems‍\nThe loneliness epidemicLoneliness is a growing epidemic. It affects 65% of Gen Z, making them the loneliest generation. Relationships are crucial for happiness, yet digital solutions fail to connect people meaningfully. The current systems are inadequate.\nThe causes are multi-faceted: social media promotes superficial connections, while geographic barriers and busy lifestyles lead to isolation. Further reading:\nOur Epidemic of Loneliness and IsolationThe Loneliness Pandemic‍\nImproving the world's parenting capabilityParenting is a critical skill. Yet many lack the tools to succeed. In the U.S., over 80% of parents report feeling unprepared for the challenges of raising children. This gap is significant.\nThe causes are multifaceted. Social changes have shifted family structures. Access to resources can be uneven. Many parents are overwhelmed with information but lack practical guidance.\nFurther reading:\nWe should teach people how to parentWhy Don’t We Teach People How to Parent?‍\nBetter answers for how to quantify worker productivityWorker productivity is hard to quantify. It's a crucial issue in today's economy. Studies show that productivity directly impacts profitability. For example, a 1% increase in productivity can lead to a 2% increase in profits for large companies.\nThe problem is significant. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased only 2.5% in 2021. Causes include outdated metrics and lack of real-time data. Current solutions are inadequate. Many rely on self-reported metrics or outdated surveys.\nCompanies are under pressure to optimize performance. Remote work has shifted focus onto individual productivity. New technologies can leverage this shift. Regulatory changes in data privacy also allow for better analytics.\nFurther reading:\nMeasuring Knowledge Worker Productivity: A TaxonomyThe Productivity Puzzle: Restoring Economic Dynamism‍\nIQ paradoxThe IQ paradox highlights a significant problem: the assumption that IQ is a static measure across generations. Research indicates that countries like Ireland have improved their IQ scores dramatically in recent years, suggesting environmental factors play a crucial role. This isn't just an academic issue; it's a matter of societal structure and opportunity.\nThe size of the problem is substantial. If we consider that IQ can differ by as much as 15 points between generations in some populations, this indicates a potential gap in human capital that could affect economic outputs. The causes? They range from educational access to socio-economic factors.\nFurther reading:\nHeritability Estimates Versus Large Environmental Effects: The IQ Paradox Resolved - Brookings Institution’s analysis of how environment and genetics interact in IQ developmentThe Role of Environment in Cognitive Development - Comprehensive study on environmental factors affecting intelligence‍\nArchipelago communitarianismThe problem is governance inefficiency. Large systems often result in one-size-fits-all solutions. This leads to dissatisfaction among diverse populations. The U.S. alone has over 330 million people, each with unique needs. Current governance models struggle to adapt.\nCauses include bureaucratic inertia and lack of competition. Many citizens feel trapped in systems that don't serve them.\nThe rise of remote work and digital communities has changed how people interact with governance. Regulatory shifts are making local governance more feasible. Geopolitical tensions are pushing for more agile systems.\nFurther reading:\nArchipelago and Atomic CommunitarianismArchipelagos: Decentralized Organizations and Their Challenges‍\nPrediction markets are underutilisedPrediction markets are underutilized.

They keep people in poverty and force them to live in dangerous situations. Right now, 750 million people worldwide would migrate if they could. That’s a huge market. Only 356,000 were refused visas to the U.S. in 2021.\nThe reasons are clear. Governments want to control borders. This leads to strict regulations and a booming underground economy for human trafficking. Current efforts to solve the problem include discussions around easing restrictions and addressing the humanitarian aspects of migration.\nFurther reading:\nThe U.S. Immigration Debate - Council on Foreign Relations analysisDomesticating the Giant: The Global Governance of Migration‍\nFactory farmingTrillions of animals are involved. Estimates suggest 400 billion to 3 trillion vertebrates are killed each year. The majority live in appalling conditions. About 97.5% of farmed animals end up in factory farms. The suffering is real and often overlooked.\nThe root causes are economic. The demand for cheap meat drives farmers to prioritize profit over animal welfare. The lack of regulation allows abusive practices to persist. Awareness is growing, but change is slow.\nCurrent efforts focus on humane treatment and alternative proteins. Companies are exploring lab-grown meat and plant-based substitutes. Further reading:\nFactory Farming: Misery for AnimalsThe Factory Farming Conundrum: Is It Ethical?‍\nRisks of stable totalitarianismTotalitarian regimes killed over 100 million people in the 20th century. If one such regime could maintain power indefinitely, it could condemn billions to oppression. The risk is not theoretical; the combination of advanced technology and political ambition poses a real threat.\nThe emergence of technologies like AI, surveillance, and autonomous weapons could empower totalitarianism. Historical patterns show that regimes often fall due to external competition, internal resistance, and succession problems. But technology may allow a regime to overcome these hurdles.\nFurther reading:\nRisks of Stable Totalitarianism - 80,000 Hours analysisTotalitarian Potential - Harari’s warning‍\nSuffering risks 's-risks'Suffering risks, or s-risks, are a pressing issue. They focus on the potential for extreme suffering in future generations, often worse than extinction. The scale is alarming — we might be looking at suffering on a level never seen before if technological advancements concentrate power and control in harmful ways.\nTechnological advancements like AI, surveillance, and biological weapons can lead to authoritarian regimes. These regimes could perpetuate suffering indefinitely. The neglect of this issue means we lack comprehensive research and actionable strategies.\nEfforts to address s-risks are limited but growing. Organizations like the Center for Reducing Suffering are focusing on both narrow interventions (like safe AI development) and broad ones (promoting international cooperation). However, more work is needed to raise awareness and develop effective strategies.\nFurther reading:\nBeginner’s Guide to Reducing S-Risks - CLR’s comprehensive guideUnderstanding S-Risks - Center for Reducing Suffering overview‍\nWild animal suffering is a significant yet overlooked problemMost wild animals live short, painful lives, often dying from disease, hunger, or predation. For instance, only one in millions of juvenile animals survive to adulthood. This suffering is largely ignored in the broader animal welfare conversation.\nThe causes are multifaceted. Nature is brutal, and while suffering is inherent, it doesn't mean we shouldn't care. There's little effort directed at alleviating this suffering, largely because it's seen as a natural condition.\nCurrent efforts in wild animal welfare are nascent. Unlike farmed animal welfare, which has seen tangible wins, wild animal welfare is less tractable due to the complexity of ecosystems. Interventions can be risky, with unpredictable outcomes. However, some advocacy groups have begun to make progress, indicating potential for effective solutions.\nFurther reading:\nWild Animal Welfare - 80,000 Hours analysisMistreatment of Wild Animals - Ballard Brief overview\n‍\nWe need more positive valuesWe need more positive values in society. Historically, dominant groups have sidelined minorities. This has caused suffering and inequality. In the last 300 years, we’ve seen some progress, but the work is far from done.\nThe size of the problem is substantial. Millions still experience discrimination based on gender, race, or other factors. For instance, over 1.3 billion people live in extreme poverty, highlighting a desperate need for altruism and concern for others.\nThe causes are multifaceted. They include entrenched social norms, lack of education, and insufficient advocacy.\nFurther reading:\nHow humanity’s idea of who deserves moral concern has grown — and will keep growingPromoting positive values‍\nGlobal public goods are underfunded and often neglectedGlobal public goods are critically underfunded.

Only 40% of college students are male, down from nearly 60% in 1970. This gap leads to lower earning potential. Men without a degree earn $900,000 less over their lifetimes. The decline in marriage rates compounds the issue, creating a growing population of \"broke and lonely\" men. The causes are multifaceted. Educational expectations for boys are lower. Boys face higher suspension rates than girls. The social landscape is changing; young men are living at home in record numbers. In 2020, 52% of young adults lived with their parents, a significant increase from pre-pandemic levels.\nFurther reading:\nThe Male Student Crisis in Higher Education - Brookings Institution analysisMen Skipping College: Impact on Economy \u0026 Health - Comprehensive study‍\nYoung adults are struggling to leave homeYoung adults are stuck at home.

Studies show that between 50-78% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. The median wealth per adult globally is only $7,522. These figures highlight a widespread issue: financial insecurity and unfulfilling work.\nThe causes are rooted in economic structures. Rising costs outpace wages, forcing families to work multiple jobs. Debt traps individuals in cycles of payments, preventing them from pursuing their passions. The professional class often finds itself in high-paying but unfulfilling roles, inflating lifestyles faster than incomes.\nFurther reading:\nMeaningful Work, Well-Being, and Health - Academic researchFreedom and meaningful work: an exploration‍\nToo many people hide or don't pursue their ambitionMany people hide their ambitions.

But most of it is consumed by sensationalized news. This trend is growing. In 2022, 57% of Americans reported feeling overwhelmed by news. The causes? A mix of social media algorithms and the business model of news organizations that thrive on clicks.\nCurrent solutions are half-hearted. Some platforms are trying to promote long-form journalism. Others are developing tools for better news curation. But these efforts are fragmented. They lack a comprehensive approach.\nFurther reading:\nHow the news changes the way we think and behaveThe Impact of Digital Platforms on News and Journalistic Content‍\nThere is still too much scarcityWe don't have enough food, medicine, or critical components like semiconductor chips.

They fear judgment and failure. This problem is widespread. An estimated 70% of individuals feel pressured to conform, stifling their true aspirations.

A recent study shows that 60% of adults can't name a single historical event from more than 50 years ago.

But most of it is consumed by sensationalized news. This trend is growing. In 2022, 57% of Americans reported feeling overwhelmed by news. The causes? A mix of social media algorithms and the business model of news organizations that thrive on clicks.</p><p>Current solutions are half-hearted.
