Ability to say “I don’t know” and ask questionsCounterintuitively, the highest performers ask the dumbest questions. They prefer to understand than to be perceived to understand; they prefer to be right than to be perceived to be right. ‍\n4. Think before doingHigh performers plan the work before working on the plan. There’s nothing worse than trying to complete a project with vague actions: it creates mental fatigue and procrastination because the next steps aren’t clear. “Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.” — Abraham Lincoln\n‍\n5. Ability to limit distractionsHigh performers minimise interruptions, manage digital distractions, and protect focus time. They don’t ‘stroll’ their way through the work day; they own it.\n‍\n6. Ability to zoom in and zoom out\nHigh performers understand the context of their work in the bigger picture. This allows them to question a) whether the work should be done in the first place and b) how to do the work most effectively. High-performers often say, “I don’t think we need to do this — here’s why” or “I think there’s a better way to do this.”\n‍\n7. Bring solutions, not problemsInstead of pointing out problems to seniors, high performers come prepared with potential solutions. This demonstrates initiative but also accelerates problem-solving and decision-making. There’s no sweeter feeling for a senior than having their problems swept away by high-performers.\n‍\n8. Don’t seek feedbackCounterintuitively, the best people to work with don’t seek feedback—they get feedback automatically because of the quality of their performance.The best feedback of all? Quick promotions, requests to be on more teams, getting assigned challenges ahead of their peers, and seniors asking to work with them frequently. Seeking feedback too readily can project insecurity and a belief that you’re not performing as well as you could. Guess what? You’re probably right. ‍\nDon’t conflate this with meaning that high-performers can’t receive feedback constructively—they can; they just don’t have to often.\n‍\n9. Close loops quicklyHigh performers don't leave tasks or projects hanging. They prioritise completing what they've started and ruthlessly “clear the decks.” They communicate proactively to manage expectations if they’re delayed for any reason. This habit builds trust and reliability, as colleagues know they can count on them to follow through.\n‍\n10. Done is better than perfectHigh performers know when to go slow and when to go fast. Most work requires only 80% good enough solutions; often, ‘done’ is better than spending additional time to perfect it. ‍\n11. Doing—not just thinking—two steps aheadTop performers don't just react to current situations; they anticipate what happens next. A client sends an email to a Senior with a request, and a high-performer is cc’d. The Senior receives a second email within 5-10 minutes with a suggested approach to the client’s request and a notification letting the Senior know that they’re already working on it. “Here’s how I think we should handle it; let me know if you have an alternative approach; otherwise, I’ll have this for your review in 2 hours.” ‍\n12. Ruthless time efficiencyHigh achievers guard their time fiercely. They know that Parkinson’s Law (work expands to fill the time allotted to it) applies to all work. They prioritise tasks ruthlessly, focusing on high-impact activities and eliminating or delegating low-value work. They're masters of saying \"no\" to preserve their focus on what truly matters.\n","wordCount":"674","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-07-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-07-02T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-what-i-learned-at-goldman-sachs/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Alex Brogan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://alexbrogan.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://alexbrogan.com/ accesskey=h title="Alex Brogan (Alt + H)">Alex Brogan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
