It’s useful when it changes your behaviour. It is true that not all life advice is useful over time. What’s useful now may not be useful in 10 years. What was useful 5 years ago, isn’t useful now.
‍
For this reason, periodically assessing the ‘advice you most need to hear’ and keeping that front of mind is pivotal to becoming the highest version of yourself. If you are already performing in alignment with a given set of advice, you don’t need to remind yourself of specific advice. ...</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2025-07-02 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 2, 2025</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Advice you most need to hear" href=https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-advice/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Agency is your ability to shape circumstances</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Agency is your ability to shape circumstances instead of being shaped by them.
Most people live their entire lives as spectators. They watch others build companies, create movements, and change history. They attribute success to luck, timing, or privilege. This is a comforting illusion that protects their ego.
The truth is simpler and harder to accept: agency is a choice.
Every billionaire, world-changer, and history-maker made this choice. They decided they wouldn't accept the world as given. They would bend reality instead. This isn't mystical — it's mechanical. You either believe your actions matter or you don't.

Work insanely hard in your 20’s. Weekends are a social construct popularised by Henry Ford in the early 20th century to encourage people to travel more (so they would use his cars). Do with this information what you will.‍

It's 2012. I'm 15, and it's my first time overseas without a parent. I'm with my club water polo team in Belgrade for a training camp before the National Championships. We’re at Partizan, arguably the world’s most famous club, known for its long list of Olympians.  I’m excited to test myself against the best. I rate myself. How good could they be? I started playing water polo 4 years ago. Between swimming, gym, and actual sessions, I’ve been training up to 13 times a week. It’s all I do and think about.

I'm training with the Western Australian State School Boys team ahead of the National Championships in June. It's our first session, and my coach, Andrew, is splitting the squad into two teams for a practice game.

Ann Miura-Ko (@annimaniac) has been labelled the most powerful woman in start-ups by Forbes. She is:
A co-founding partner of Floodgate Venture CapitalAn early investor and board member in LyftA lecturer in entrepreneurship at StanfordAnd a world-class debaterAnn’s parents came to America seeking opportunity having grown up in post-WW2 Japan. They had almost no money, spoke very little English, and had no support system when they arrived. What they did have was a steely grit and determination to make a life in America. Her father worked intensely to receive a PhD in mechanical and aerospace engineering.

Who people choose to partner with says more than anything they say. It tells us more about their desires, assumptions, and needs than anything else. It indicates their priorities and values, as well as what they think of themselves.
(2) Observe How They Handle No
Rejection is a big part of life. Those who take "No" poorly usually have an overinflated sense of entitlement. The world owes no one anything. Those who accept and live by this are people you can share bad news with easily.
