It’s useful when it changes your behaviour. It is true that not all life advice is useful over time. What’s useful now may not be useful in 10 years. What was useful 5 years ago, isn’t useful now.&lt;/p>&lt;p id="">‍&lt;br>&lt;/p>&lt;p id="">For this reason, periodically assessing the ‘advice you most need to hear’ and keeping that front of mind is pivotal to becoming the highest version of yourself. If you are already performing in alignment with a given set of advice, you don’t need to remind yourself of specific advice. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Agency is your ability to shape circumstances</title><link>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-agency-is-your-ability-to-shape-circumstances/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-agency-is-your-ability-to-shape-circumstances/</guid><description>&lt;p id="">&lt;strong id="">Agency is your ability to shape circumstances instead of being shaped by them.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>&lt;p id="">Most people live their entire lives as spectators. They watch others build companies, create movements, and change history. They attribute success to luck, timing, or privilege. &lt;strong id="">This is a comforting illusion that protects their ego.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>&lt;p id="">The truth is simpler and harder to accept: agency is a choice.&lt;/p>&lt;p id="">Every billionaire, world-changer, and history-maker made this choice. They decided they wouldn't accept the world as given. They would bend reality instead. This isn't mystical — it's mechanical. You either believe your actions matter or you don't.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Career things I'd tell my younger self</title><link>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-career/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-career/</guid><description>&lt;p id="">&lt;strong id="">Brand names (Stripe, Anthropic, Goldman Sachs, McKinsey) are optional, but they do imply positive traits that people will take you seriously for.&lt;/strong> If you don’t get a brand name, you can still imply your capabilities in a permissionless way through the internet.

Serbia’s July sun beats down mercilessly, but it's not just the heat that's making my palms clammy.&lt;/p>&lt;p>‍&lt;/p>&lt;p id="">It's 2012. I'm 15, and it's my first time overseas without a parent. I'm with my club water polo team in Belgrade for a training camp before the National Championships. We’re at Partizan, arguably the world’s most famous club, known for its long list of Olympians.&amp;nbsp; I’m excited to test myself against the best. I rate myself. How good could they be? I started playing water polo 4 years ago. Between swimming, gym, and actual sessions, I’ve been training up to 13 times a week. It’s all I do and think about.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Great leaders don't just manage people</title><link>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-great-leaders-dont-just-manage-people/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-great-leaders-dont-just-manage-people/</guid><description>&lt;p id="">The chlorine-scented air stings my nostrils as I catch my breath, my arms draped over the pool's edge, water lapping gently against my chest. The sun glints off the surface, but it's not the light that's making me squint – it's the anticipation of what's about to unfold. It's April 2013. I'm training with the Western Australian State School Boys team ahead of the National Championships in June. It's our first session, and my coach, Andrew, is splitting the squad into two teams for a practice game.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How can some people get so lucky in life?</title><link>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-how-can-some-people-get-so-lucky-in-life/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-how-can-some-people-get-so-lucky-in-life/</guid><description>&lt;p id="">We often think that luck is about being in the right place at the right time.

Her father worked intensely to receive a PhD in mechanical and aerospace engineering.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How the world might look in 30 years</title><link>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-predictions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-predictions/</guid><description>&lt;h5 id="">‍&lt;strong id="">By 2030&lt;/strong>&lt;/h5>&lt;p>‍&lt;/p>&lt;p id="">AI&lt;/p>&lt;ul id="">&lt;li id="">AI will surpass human capabilities in all healthcare diagnostic tasks&lt;/li>&lt;li id="">AI will be smarter than a Nobel Prize winner across biology, programming, math, engineering, writing and have access to all the interfaces available to a human working virtually, including text, audio, video, mouse and keyboard control, and internet access&lt;/li>&lt;li id="">AI-powered personal assistants became capable of generating entire new movies&lt;/li>&lt;li id="">AI will automate AI research, compressing decades of progress into single years&lt;/li>&lt;li id="">AI will displace up to 30 percent of our workforce resulting in 400 to 800 million job losses&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;p>‍&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to choose the highest leverage activities to work on</title><link>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-how-to-choose-the-highest-leverage-activities-to-work-on/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-how-to-choose-the-highest-leverage-activities-to-work-on/</guid><description>&lt;p id="">&lt;strong id="">To increase your leverage, ask yourself before any activity:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>&lt;ul id="">&lt;li id="">How could I complete this task in a fraction of the time to the same standard?

The Indian Ocean stretches before me, a vast blue expanse that seems to mock my spent body, while the merciless sun beats down above.&lt;/p>&lt;p id="">‍&lt;/p>&lt;p id="">It's 2012, and I've just completed another gruelling run-swim-run as a surf life saving cadet. As a year 10 student, I'm part of a group of fifty cadets who've chosen surf life saving as our extra-curricular activity. Every Friday afternoon, we face the same challenge: an 800-meter sand run, followed by a 500-meter swim, and another 400-meter sand run to finish.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I had a conversation with a billionaire</title><link>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-i-had-a-conversation-with-a-billionaire/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-i-had-a-conversation-with-a-billionaire/</guid><description>&lt;p id="">3 months ago, I had a short conversation with a billionaire. I asked for their book recommendations, but I got a lesson I’ll remember for the rest of my life. They told me that they don’t give advice or mentorship. That they’ve never received any value from it. &lt;/p>&lt;p id="">‍&lt;/p>&lt;p id="">They shared the view that other people’s advice is often from their own unique experience and is often wrong or at least much less valuable when applied to your own circumstance. They said that instead of seeking advice they had “read a lot and studied and experimented and failed and learned and then finally succeeded.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>If you’re not curious, you’ll never be great</title><link>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-if-youre-not-curious-youll-never-be-great/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-if-youre-not-curious-youll-never-be-great/</guid><description>&lt;p id="">The elevator doors slide shut, sealing me in with my dreams and doubts. It's 2019, and I'm ascending to the 30th floor of Goldman Sachs, my heart racing faster than the lift itself. At 21, with the dust of European cobblestones and South American trails still clinging to my shoes following a gap year, I've landed what many consider the holy grail of finance jobs.&lt;/p>&lt;p>‍&lt;/p>&lt;p id="">Despite my excitement, I'm acutely aware of how little I know. I create an extensive list of resources to learn: financial modelling, valuation techniques, industry primers – you name it. Over the next few months, I immerse myself in the material alongside my full-time job. I'm learning rapidly, and although it's not always visible, I'm improving quickly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Increasing returns to focus</title><link>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-increasing-returns-to-focus/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-increasing-returns-to-focus/</guid><description>&lt;p id="">Many people advocate for building “Range” in your career, but this is wrong. People who have built phenomenal careers with outsized returns do not do this. Instead, they do one thing at incredible depth for an astoundingly long time. In the next few decades, those who do this stand to profit even more than they have in the past.

It’s September 9, 2009, and just moments ago, I had been sitting quietly in the back row of my school chapel during a weekly assembly. I’m 12, an idealistic kid with a keen grasp of life’s possibilities. A never-ending sense of time. And a playful demeanor with a curiosity for life’s playground. But, for the last 6 months, my Dad has been in a stoic battle with cancer. And it’s finally getting the better of him. It’s spread to his liver. And it’s terminal.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Others' reactions to you reveal their relationship with themselves</title><link>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-others-reactions-to-you-reveal-their-relationship-with-themselves/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-others-reactions-to-you-reveal-their-relationship-with-themselves/</guid><description>&lt;p>‍&lt;strong id="">Others' reactions to you reveal their relationship with themselves, not your worth.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>&lt;p id="">People's behavior rarely has anything to do with you. It's projection. A mirror of their inner world. Most take it personally anyway. When someone lashes out, we instinctively believe we caused it. We didn't. Their reaction comes from somewhere else entirely. Some unresolved pain. Some private battle you know nothing about.&lt;/p>&lt;p id="">&lt;strong id="">The moment you see others' behavior as their own internal struggle externalized, you gain freedom.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Preparation kills anxiety</title><link>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-preparation-kills-anxiety/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-preparation-kills-anxiety/</guid><description>&lt;p id="">I’m sweating profusely in fear and anxiety. It’s June 2015, I’m sitting in an exam room—the classic gymnasium filled with plastic chairs and wooden desks wall-to-wall, shoulder to shoulder.&amp;nbsp; It's my intro to Finance exam, notoriously difficult. It’s only 15 minutes in but it feels like it’s been an hour. I can't focus. It feels like time is standing still. Thoughts rush through my mind: "There's no way I'm going to pass this. If I don't, I might fail the unit, and it's going to be a blemish on my record forever. Why is this exam so hard?”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Problems worth thinking about</title><link>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-problems/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-problems/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="">Agriculture&lt;/h1>&lt;p id="">‍&lt;/p>&lt;h5 id="">Feeding 10 billion people by 2050 is a huge challenge (food)&lt;/h5>&lt;p id="">Feeding 10 billion people by 2050 is a monumental challenge. We need to produce more food in the next 30 years than in all of human history. This requires a shift in how we grow food, as arable land is decreasing due to erosion—over half has likely been lost since agriculture began. Fossil fuel dependence for fertilizers poses another risk, highlighted by soaring food prices after the Ukraine crisis.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shelves of

Most do.&lt;/p>&lt;p id="">As Thomas Newkirk put it:&lt;br>&lt;strong id="">"Embarrassment is a true enemy of learning."&lt;/strong>&lt;br>It blocks full engagement with the learning process.

High agency&lt;/strong>&lt;/h5>&lt;p id="">High-agency people happen to the world; the world doesn’t happen to them. They take ultimate responsibility and see everything as a problem to be solved with creative solutions. If they haven’t solved a problem before, they speak to someone who has or find an answer. They never ask, “How do I do this?” without first trying to answer that themselves.&lt;/p>&lt;p>‍&lt;/p>&lt;h5 id="">&lt;strong id="">2. High-speed communication&lt;/strong>‍&lt;/h5>&lt;p id="">Let’s be real: Communication is a core part of any role. Those who respond quickly are people we consider to have their “sh*t” together. This is no different in the workplace. Speed demonstrates attentiveness and conscientiousness—two critical predictors of success.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What trait do 9/10 billionaires credit for their success?</title><link>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-what-trait-do-9-10-billionaires-credit-for-their-success/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alexbrogan.com/essays/2025-07-02-what-trait-do-9-10-billionaires-credit-for-their-success/</guid><description>&lt;p id="">What trait do 9/10 billionaires credit for their success? “Agency” Here’s what it is and how you can develop it…&lt;/p>&lt;figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center">&lt;div id="">&lt;img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/66fcf9e9f9f4b328f750b2dd_66fcf7fb80f35ea40cbc9718_X%2520tweet%2520image.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id="">&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>&lt;p id="">Agency is influencing the external environment to shape it in your favour. It’s moving from passive receiver of circumstances to active shaper of reality. It’s rejecting the world's status quo and making a new world instead. It’s removing the word “No” from your vocabulary.&lt;/p>&lt;p>‍&lt;/p>&lt;p id="">It’s acting on impulses that hide behind shadows of fear, doubt, and comparison. It’s noticing something that isn’t right and having the courage to make it so. It’s changing history by sheer force of will. Agentic people happen to the world; the world doesn’t happen to them.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
