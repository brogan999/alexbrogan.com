Join Free!\nThis Week: 10 of the best frameworks and mental models to foster high-performance Introversion vs ExtraversionA mental model that can be extrapolated to mean: ‚ÄúPeople are not interchangeable.‚Äù To maximise the success of any venture, put people in positions that maximise their strengths and minimise their weaknesses. Don‚Äôt fight nature, embrace it.\nPygmalion EffectHigher expectations lead to improved performance.\nThe highest performing companies‚Äîand people‚Äîare typically those with the highest internal expectations. Want to achieve more? Start with your expectations.\nDirectly Responsible IndividualA DRI is someone made explicitly responsible for completing a task or project. It prevents situations where work isn‚Äôt completed and it‚Äôs unclear who was responsible for making sure it happened. A DRI provides clarity and no room for excuses.\nLaw of TrivialityPeople spend a high % of their time on minor issues.\nWhy? Trivial issues are easier to understand and form opinions about‚Äîthey don‚Äôt require serious thinking. High-performance companies don‚Äôt waste time or money on issues that don‚Äôt move the needle.\nCrew Resource Management (CRM)An idea from the airline industry involving promoting the voices of all crew members.\nIt dissuades hierarchical decision making by encouraging Crew members to raise issues freely. The voice of all matters more than the voice of one.\nSeek Disconfirming EvidenceDisconfirming evidence is ignoring information that contradicts existing beliefs. It‚Äôs comfortable to ignore what makes you feel uncomfortable. But the smartest companies embrace disconfirming evidence to prevent long-term failure.\nForcing FunctionForcing functions are anything that ‚Äúforces‚Äù a desired action to be completed. For example, sharing a product launch date with customers is a forcing function to build the product on time. Why are they useful? They prevent excuses for not meeting goals.\nExtreme Ownership‚ÄúExtreme Ownership. Leaders must own everything in their world. There is no one else to blame.‚Äù\n‚ÄîJocko Willink Set clear expectations around what it means to take responsibility. Elite companies don't finger point or play blame games‚Äîthey own outcomes.\nHave Backbone; Disagree and Commit¬†Don‚Äôt shy away from sharing your point of view or disagreeing.\nBut, when a decision is made, let go of your ego and commit to the decision. Popularised by Amazon, this model prevents Groupthink and fosters forward progress.\nWeekly 1-1's1-1‚Äôs are a compulsory weekly meeting between employee and manager. They can be used for feedback, career development, or to share issues. Whilst a simple exercise, 1-1‚Äôs are a vital forcing function for continual improvement and monitoring sentiment.\nThere you have it, 10 of the best frameworks and mental models to foster high-performance.\nI hope you found these as helpful as I have.\nStay curious, Alex\nP.S.
