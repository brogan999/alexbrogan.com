Concepts, and Frameworks newsletter who have joined us since last week!\nThis Week: 15 timeless lessons on investing and building wealthLesson 1: “The most consistent way to get rich is to grow your income and invest in income-producing assets.\nThis doesn’t imply that you can ignore spending.\nEveryone should do a periodic review of their spending to ensure it isn’t wasteful.\nBut there is no need to cut your lattes.”\nLesson 2: “Those who benefit the most from using debt are those who can choose when to take it.\nIf you can use debt strategically to reduce risk or increase return, then you may be able to benefit from it.”\nLesson 3: “The right time to buy a home is when you can meet the following conditions:\nYou plan on being in that location for at least ten years.\nYou have a stable personal and professional life.\nYou can afford it.”\nLesson 4: “Save 25 times your expected spending by your first year of retirement.\nWhen you’ve reached this total amount of savings, you can retire.\nAnother way to determine “When can you retire?” is to find the point when your monthly investment income exceeds your monthly expenses.”\nLesson 5: The Financial Argument Against Stock Picking:\n”Since most people can’t beat a broad index of companies, you shouldn’t bother trying.”\nThe Existential Argument Against Stock Picking:\n”How do you know if you are good at picking individual stocks?”\nIt takes too long.\nLesson 6: “Because most markets going up most of the time means that every day you end up waiting to invest usually means higher prices you will have to pay in the future.\nSo, instead of waiting for the best time to invest, you should just take the plunge and invest what you can now.”\nLesson 7: “Investing sooner is the best strategy for U.S. stocks and also for nearly every other asset class out there.\nThe best market timing approach is to invest your money as soon as you can: this is backed by historical data across multiple asset classes and multiple time periods.”\nLesson 8: “When deciding between investing all your money now or over time, it’s almost always better to invest now.\nThis is true across all asset classes, time periods, and nearly all valuation regimes.\nGenerally, the longer you wait to deploy your capital, the worse off you will be.”\nLesson 9: On why you shouldn’t wait to buy the dip:\n”While you wait for your beloved dip, you may find that it never comes.\nAs a result, you end up missing out on months (or more) of compound growth as the market keeps rising and leaves you behind.”\nLesson 10: “Only three cases under which you should consider selling an investment:\nTo rebalance.\nTo get out of a concentrated (or losing) position.\nTo meet your financial needs.\nWhy?\nSelling can have tax consequences, which is something we should avoid as much as possible.”\nLesson 11: “Since most markets go up most of the time, waiting to buy usually means losing out on upside.\nBut, when it comes to selling, since markets tend to go up over time, the optimal thing to do is to sell as late as possible.\nIn other words, buy quickly, but sell slowly.”\nLesson 12: How to sell well?\n”Find a selling methodology and stick to it.\nWhether that means selling 10% chunks every month (or every quarter), selling half and letting the rest ride, or selling most of it right away, find something that allows you to sleep at night.”\nLesson 13: “Whatever you decide to do, don’t sell all of it at once.\nWhy?\nBecause of the tax consequences and the possibility of regret if the price skyrockets.\nIt’s this regret minimization framework that you should employ when deciding on how much to sell.”\nLesson 14: “Find where you are in your financial journey before deciding where to focus your time and energy.\nIf your expected savings are greater than your expected investment income, focus on savings; otherwise focus on investing.\nIf they are similar, focus on both.”\nLesson 15: And lastly, always remember:\n”No matter how successful you get with your money, there will always be someone with more.\nIf you win the financial game, make sure you don’t lose yourself in the process.”\nThese lessons come from one of the best personal finance books I’ve read in the last 5 years:\nJust Keep Buying by @dollarsanddata.\nIf these quotes piqued your interest, I highly recommend getting a full copy of Nick’s book (not an affiliate link):\nJust Keep Buying\nBooktopia has Just Keep Buying, Proven ways to save money and build your wealth by Nick Maggiulli.
