It must be the time they're playing.\"\nAlways consider common causes and other factors.\nAppeal To Emotion\nWhen you use emotion in place of reason in order to win a debate—it's a type of manipulation.\n\"Don't you care about their feelings in making this decision?\"\nAppeal to emotion without logic is a fallacy.\nHowever, matched with logic, it's a powerful force.\nThe Fallacy Fallacy\nWhen you assume that because a fallacy has been made, or a claim has been poorly argued, that the claim itself must be wrong. It's possible for a claim that is true to be justified with fallacies and weak arguments. Assess the claim first, then the rest.\nSlippery Slope\nClaiming that a relatively small first step will lead to a chain of events culminating in a significant event. This fallacy leverages fear to convince the other party that a course of action should be taken. Treat the issue at hand, not extreme hypotheticals.\nAd Hominem\nAttacking someones character, personal traits, or education in an attempt to undermine their argument. Person A: Presents compelling, logical case for social welfare\nPerson B: \"Should we believe anything this man has said given he was once arrested in college?\"\nBurden of Proof\nWhen you avoid your responsbility to provide proof for your reasoning by denying the need to do so, pretending to have done so, or by shifting the responsibility elsewhere. For example, claiming something is valid purely because no one can 'prove' you wrong.\nLoaded Question\nAsking a question with a presumption built into it so that it can't be answered without appearing guilty.\nThe recipient is compelled to defend themselves and is on the back foot. “Are you naive enough to believe the news, or do you not care about the truth?”\nSpecial Pleading\nWhen you move the goalposts or make up an exception after your claim is shown to be false.\nThis can involve rationalizing a reason why what you thought to be true must remain to be true after it's shown to be false.\nLet go of your old beliefs with integrity.\nPersonal Incredulity\nWhen you find something difficult to understand, or are unaware of how it works, you exert that it's probably not true.\n“I can’t imagine how humans evolved from single-celled organisms; it doesn’t make sense to me. I don't believe the theory of evolution.”\nTu Quoque\nWhen you avoid having to engage with criticism by turning it back on the accuser—you answer criticism with criticism.\nPerson A: I don't agree with how you acted yesterday. Person B: I remember when you did something similar 2 years ago. How do you explain that?\nThe Appeal to Credentials Fallacy\nDismissing advice by stating that whoever gave it doesn’t have proper credentials, so their advice must be wrong or unimportant.\nIt's problematic because credentials ≠ expertise.\nYou can pay for credentials but you can't pay for expertise.\nThe Gamblers Fallacy\nWhen you believe that a random event is more or less likely based on the outcome of a previous event or series of events.\nPast events don't change the probability that certain events will occur in the future.\nEach event must be considered independently.\nMoral Equivalence\nThinking that two things are morally equivalent when they're not.\nFor example, thinking that racist language and an assault have the same severity.\nNo. One is an act of violence while the other is words. Different wrongful conduct has different severity.\nAmbiguity\nUsing a double meaning or ambiguity of language to mislead or misrepresent the truth. \"Sure philosophy helps you argue better, but do we really need to encourage people to argue? There's enough hostility in this world.\"\nPoliticians are often guilty of this fallacy.\nRed Herring\nA deliberate diversion from a relevant or important question. John: It's morally wrong to lie to your spouse, why on earth did you do that?\nSteve: But what is morality exactly?\nJohn: It’s a code of conduct shared by cultures.\nSteve: But who creates this code?\nThat's it!
