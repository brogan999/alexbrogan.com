He‚Äôs one of my all-time favourite thinkers and will be sorely missed in the world.\nThe following are 20 of his most powerful maxim‚Äôs on living well.\nIf you want to dig deeper on Dee Hock, head to his website here.\nNo dream is so great as the person you might become by remaining true to it.\nIt is a wise man who knows whether he is in complete error or deluded by partial truth.\nThere is nothing that can‚Äôt be imposed on an indifferent many by a dedicated few.\nAdvice is as abundant as help is rare. People who ask for advice more often need help but rarely get it. People who ask for help rarely need advice but often get it. It is a kindness to the world to be liberal with help and chary with advice.\nWisdom finds humor in everything; old, barren reason alone is deadly serious.\nWe judge others harshly by the standards we profess rather than those we practice. Yet we resent it bitterly when they return the favor.\nWhen life is frightening or distasteful, scholarship is always a suitable sanctuary.\nWho takes a step bereft of love walks to death in shrouds of calculation to lie forever embalmed by money in a mausoleum of things.\nEthics pale when money growls.\nThose who despise people are the most desperate to be favorably recognized by them.\nThat which is growing looks only ahead; that which is declining looks only behind.\nThis day brought health, moderation, someone to love, work to be done, and a clear sky under which to do it. What more could anyone want?\nCondemnation debases the condemner far more than the condemned.\nIf you never test your courage and strength, how can you measure the validity of your fears?\nAs my grandfather used to say, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs them as talks and them as does, and them as does gives them as talks a passel to natter about.‚Äù\nThe pleasures of youth are the pains of old age, just as the pleasures of old age are the pains of youth.\nHumility and generosity have no enemies.\nOne should not read like a dog obeying its master, but like an eagle hunting its prey.\nYou can give no greater gift than to speak and write that which is useful to your own heart.\nLike fishermen, we constantly cast the lure of expectation ahead of us, hoping to hook a desired piece of the future. Something unimaginable always takes the bait.\nAnd hey, for good measure, one bonus: Happiness may be difficult, but it is not complicated. Dismiss desire, discard opinion, honor the past, trust the future, and treasure the moment.\nThere you have it, 20 maxim‚Äôs for a fulfilling life from the incredible Dee Hock.¬†I hope you found these as helpful as I have.\nStay curious, Alex\nP.S.
