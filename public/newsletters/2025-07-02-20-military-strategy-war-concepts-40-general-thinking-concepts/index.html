Highlights of this newsletter:20 important Military strategy \u0026 War concepts40 concepts for improving general thinkingA Crowdsourced List Of The Best Resources On The Internet\nMilitary Strategy \u0026 War ConceptsSeeing the Front\nOne of the most valuable military tactics\nInvolves “personally seeing the front line” before making decisions—not always relying on advisors, maps, and reports, all of which can be either faulty or biased\nSeeing the Front improves the quality of insights\nAsymmetric Warfare\nA type of warfare in which two parties have different military capabilities or methods of war\nIn such a case, the weak party must take advantage of its special advantages or the opponent’s weaknesses in order to have any opportunity to achieve its goals\nTwo-Front War\nOccurs when opposing forces approach two geographically separate fronts in order to divide and disperse the defenders troops, and create logistical difficulties\nWW2 was a good example: Germany was forced to defend two front's when they became enemies with Russia\nCounterinsurgency\nVarious tactics and strategies used to combat armed insurgency (violent, armed war against authority waged by small forces)\nIt's the blend of comprehensive civilian and military efforts designed to simultaneously contain insurgency and address its root causes\nMutually Assured Destruction\nA situation where two parties are in a stalemate, and neither can make a move without causing their own destruction\nParadoxically, the stronger two opponents become, the less likely they may be to destroy one another\nProxy War\nAn armed conflict between two states or non-state actors which act on the instigation or on behalf of other parties that are not directly involved in the hostilities\nExample: Cuban Missile Crisis\nGuerilla Warfare\nA form of warfare where small groups of soldiers, such as paramilitary or armed civilians use military tactics including ambushes, sabotage, raids, petty warfare, hit-and-run tactics, and mobility, to fight a larger and less-mobile traditional military\nFlypaper Theory\nInvolves deliberately attracting enemies to a location where they are more vulnerable, like attracting flies to flypaper, usually also directing them far away from your valuable assets\nFor example, U.S. ground forces in Iraq preventing attacks on U.S. soil\nFighting the Last War\nArmies by default use strategies, tactics, and technology that worked for them in the past (last war)\nThe problem is that what was most useful for the last war may not be best for the next one. This can mean smaller forces prevail with better tactics\nRumsfeld's Rule\nYou go to war with the army you have. They’re not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time\nOrganizations hardly ever have perfect resources, but they can't always afford to wait until they have better ones before moving forward\nTrojan Horse\nA strategy in which a warring party is tricked into letting in the enemy behind their defenses\nA Trojan horse can refer to anything that persuades you to lower your defenses by seeming harmless or even attractive, like a gift\nExit Strategy\nA means of leaving a current situation, either after a predetermined objective has been achieved, or as a strategy to mitigate failure\nAt worst, an exit strategy will save face; at best, it will deliver an objective worth more than continuing the previous plan\nEmpty Fort Strategy\nInvolves using reverse psychology (and luck) to deceive the enemy into thinking that an empty location is full of traps and ambushes, and therefore induce the enemy to retreat\nBoots On The Ground\nUsed to convey the belief that military success can only be achieved through the direct physical presence of troops (wearing boots) in a conflict area\nConducting a war just from afar—for example, using only air power—will not achieve the ultimate goals\nWinning Hearts and Minds\nA concept used in the resolution of war, insurgency, ano other conflicts, to express prevailing not by the use of superior physical force, but by making emotional or intellectual appeals to sway supporters of the other side\nContainment\nAn attempt to contain the enemy, to prevent its further expansion, be it expanding geographically, militarily, or politically\nContaining acknowledges that an undesirable event has happened, that you can't easily undo it, and so instead tries to mitigate further loss\nAppeasement\nMaking concessions to opponents in order to avoid direct or further conflict with them\nIf you are in no position to meaningfully deter or contain an emerging conflict that you’d like to avoid, appeasement may be a necessary evil\nWinning A Battle But Losing The War (AKA, a Phyrric Victory)\nRefers to achieving a minor victory that ultimately results in a larger defeat, rendering the victory empty or hollow\nIt can also refer to gaining a small tactical advantage that corresponds to a wider disadvantage\nBeachhead\nA beachhead is a temporary line that a military unit establishes and holds until reinforcements arrive and they can make an advance\nBusinesses can use a beachhead by concentrating resources in one small area and succeeding first before moving on to bigger markets\nAttrition Warfare\nA warfare where the opponents are so strong that an end can only be reached through an extended and mutual depletion of each other’s resources\nIn these situations, the side with the largest reserves of resources typically wins in the long-run\nGeneral Thinking ConceptsPain, Chemicals And Diseases\nThe tendency to become confused when we are in pain, under the influence of chemicals or have a physical or mental illness\nBefore making important decisions, ensure you are free of these influences and your senses are not distorted\nMultiple Tendencies\nThe tendency for multiple psychological biases operating together to lead to irrationality on a tremendous scale\nCorporate boards are a great example: Incentive-caused bias, Liking bias, Authority bias, Social Proof Bias, Reciprocation, and many more...\nIt'll Get Worse Before It Gets Better Fallacy\nIf someone selling you something tells you this, be wary\nIf the problem continues to worsen, their prediction is confirmed and you'll believe they're competent. If it improves, they're right and you'll be happy. Either way, they win\nCoincidence Effect\nThe tendency to underestimate the inevitability of unlikely events\nDue to the sheer number of events that happen daily, unlikely events are more common than you'd expect\nWhat would be more surprising is if improbable events never came to be\nThe Anchor\nThe tendency to be subconsciously influenced by initial data points in settings including negotiations, purchases, or estimates\nFor example, the “recommended retail price” on a producty or an initial quote for a service may be nothing more than an anchor\nBe cautious\nInduction\nThe tendency to assume that because something has happened in the past, it will continue to happen in the future\nInductive thinking can lead to overconfidence and have devastating results\nWe must remember that certainties are always provisional\nForecast Illusion\nExpert predictions aren't as good as we think they are\nIf they're wrong, they enjoy free reign with few negative consequences because hardly anyone remembers. If they're right, the world will know about it\nAnalyse track records when assessing predictions\nAssociation Bias\nThe tendency to see connections where none exist\nExample: If we eat a foreign food and feel sick afterward, we avoid it in future\nWe should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it—and stop there\nBeginner's Luck\nCreating a (false) link with the past based on a positive first-experience\nYour first investment in the stock market proves to be a huge success. You believe you have real skill\nBouyed by this confidence, you bet more than you can afford and lose it all\n'Because' Justification\nThe tendency for the simple justification of \"because\" to be sufficient for encountering more tolerance and helpfulness for our behaviour\nA: \"Why haven't you done this work yet?\" B: \"Because, I haven't got around to it.\"\nA: \"Oh, that's okay then!\"\nContagion Bias\nWe avoid contact with people or objects viewed as \"contaminated\" by previous contact with someone or something viewed as bad\nE.g., we view a person who has touched a diseased person as likely to have the disease (regardless of the contagiousness of the disease)\nThe Problem With Averages\nUsing averages is troublesome when extreme cases (outliers) dominate the distribution. In these cases, we should discount the term \"average\"\nIf someone uses the word “average,” think twice. Try to work out the underlying distribution\nMotivation Crowding\nThe tendency for financial rewards to erode any other non-monetary motivations\nWhen you offer your friend money to babysit, it will feel like a transaction, making them less likely to want to do it from a place of friendship\nAsk: Should this be monetary?\nWill Rogers Phenomenon\nOccurs when moving an element from one set to another set raises the average values of both sets\nPre-conditions:\nThe element being moved is below average for its current setThe element being moved is above the current average of the set it's enteringExpectations\nThe tendency for expectations to significantly change our interpretation of reality\nIf we expect one thing, but get something drastically different, we'll be more affected than we would have been had we expected something in the middle\nExpect the unexpected\nSimple Logic\nOur tendency to use sensing or intuition over thinking because rational consideration requires more willpower\nWe give our best guess and scrutinise less to save effort\nNot everything that seems plausible is true. Reject the easy answers that pop into your head\nVolunteer's Folly\nThe tendency for volunteers to miscalculate the impact of physical volunteering compared to making another, more impactful contribution\nVolunteering is an admirable thing to do. However, we should always ask: Is this the best possible way to contribute?\nInability to Close Doors\nOur tendency to do everything we can to keep open the maximum number of options\nThere is no such thing as a free option: each one costs mental energy and eats up precious time We must learn to close doors to focus on the few that really matter\nNeomania\nThe mania for all things new and shiny\nWhen thinking of the future, we place far too much emphasis on recent technology while underestimating the role of traditional technology\nRule of thumb: Whatever has survived for X years will last another X years (Lindy Effect)\nSleeper Effect\nThe tendency for any knowledge that stems from an untrustworthy source to gain credibility over time\nThe source of the argument fades faster than the argument\nIn other words, your brain quickly forgets where the information came from, but not the message\nAlternative Blindness\nWe systematically forget to compare an existing offer with the next-best alternatives\nIf you have trouble making a decision, remember that the choices are broader than “option A” or “option B”\nOpen your eyes to alternatives that aren't in plain sight\nFalsification of History\nWe subconsciously adjust our past views to fit present ones to avoid any embarrassing proof of our fallibility\nAdmitting mistakes is emotionally difficult, so it's a clever coping strategy\nIt is safe to assume that half of what you remember is wrong\nFear of Regret\nThe tendency to act irrationally when faced with the feeling of making the wrong decision or missing out on an opportunity that might not come around again\nWe don't like to imagine feeling regretful, so we act, even if the opportunity will come around again\nPersonification\nHumans have an impressive sense of how others think and feel. We are influenced more by human stories than statistics\nWhen looking to influence, lead with the names and faces, not statistics\nPeople will be more motivated when they can relate to real humans\nIllusion of Attention\nOur tendency to be confident that we notice everything that takes place in front of us, when in reality, we often see only what we are focusing on\nRemember this video?\nLet go of the dangerous illusion that you perceive everything\nStrategic Misrepresentation\nThe tendency to falsely assert our ability to complete a task when we believe our false assertion is required to receive the opportunity\nExample: Bending the truth in job interviews\nDon't go on what people claim; look at their past performance\nOverthinking\nOur tendency to think too much and cut off our mind from our intuition\nWhen should we listen to our head and when to our gut?\nHead: When faced with a new, complex scenario where we have no expertise\nGut: When faced with practiced activities or familiar questions\nDeformation Professionalle\nThe tendency for people to solve problems using their areas of expertise\nExamples: Armies think of military solutions first. Engineers, structural\nThis becomes hazardous when people apply specialised proccesses in areas where they don't belong\nIllusion of Skill\nThe tendency to falsely attribute success to skill, forgetting the critical role luck plays\nIn some fields, skill plays the critical role in success: Pilots, Lawyers, Accountants\nIn others, luck becomes more important:: Entrepreneurship, Business, Investing\nFeature-Positive Effect\nThe tendency to place greater emphasis on what is present rather than what is absent. Absence is much harder to detect than presence\nWe realize if there is a war, but we do not appreciate the absence of war during peacetime\nThe same for good health\nCherry-Picking\nThe tendency to showcase the most attractive features of something, while downplaying or hiding the less attractive\nExamples: Company earnings reports, real estate images, internal company meetings\nRemember: You can learn more from the 'leftover' cherries\nIntention-to-Treat Error\nIn reputable studies, participants should be analyzed as belonging to whatever treatment group they were randomized into, whether or not the treatment course was completed as intended—this helps avoid bias\n\"Once randomised, always analysed”\nNews Illusion\nThe tendency for news to distort our mental maps of the risks and threats we actually face\nNews is created with gripping stories and sensational “facts” to capture our attention\nInstead of news, we should read timeless content: background articles and books\nEloquence\nWe underestimate our ability to become persuasive speakers or writers through dedicated learning\nWe aren't born persausive, we study to become persausive\nThose who can persaude effectively can start a movement. It follows, anyone can start a movement\n6 Principles of Influence - CLASSR\n6 universal principles we can use to persaude or influence, particularly in marketing, but can be used in any business setting to win hearts and minds\nSee Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion by Robert B. Cialdini for more\nCommitment \u0026 Consistency: Once we make a choice, we work to behave consistently with that choice in order to save face\nLiking: We agree with people we like, and others agree with us if they like us\nAuthority: We are more likely to say “yes” to others who are authorities\nSocial Proof: We look to other people to provide us with the correct actions to take. The more people we see taking an action, the more influenced we are\nScarcity: We want something more when there is very little of it\nReciprocation: We want to repay favours from others\nA Crowdsourced List Of The Best Resources On The InternetAnd finally, for those of you who missed it last week, I shared a list of the best resources I've found over the last 7 years across a broad range of topics including:\nBeing effectiveCommunicationLearningReadingStartupsWealth Creation...and lots more!You can find it here.‍\n","wordCount":"2552","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-07-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-07-02T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://alexbrogan.com/newsletters/2025-07-02-20-military-strategy-war-concepts-40-general-thinking-concepts/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Alex Brogan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://alexbrogan.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://alexbrogan.com/ accesskey=h title="Alex Brogan (Alt + H)">Alex Brogan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
