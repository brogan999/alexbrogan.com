They’re not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time</p><p id="">Organizations hardly ever have perfect resources, but they can't always afford to wait until they have better ones before moving forward</p><p id=""><strong id="">Trojan Horse</strong></p><p id="">A strategy in which a warring party is tricked into letting in the enemy behind their defenses</p><p id="">A Trojan horse can refer to anything that persuades you to lower your defenses by seeming harmless or even attractive, like a gift</p><p id=""><strong id="">Exit Strategy</strong></p><p id="">A means of leaving a current situation, either after a predetermined objective has been achieved, or as a strategy to mitigate failure</p><p id="">At worst, an exit strategy will save face; at best, it will deliver an objective worth more than continuing the previous plan</p><p id=""><strong id="">Empty Fort Strategy</strong></p><p id="">Involves using reverse psychology (and luck) to deceive the enemy into thinking that an empty location is full of traps and ambushes, and therefore induce the enemy to retreat</p><p id=""><strong id="">Boots On The Ground</strong></p><p id="">Used to convey the belief that military success can only be achieved through the direct physical presence of troops (wearing boots) in a conflict area</p><p id="">Conducting a war just from afar—for example, using only air power—will not achieve the ultimate goals</p><p id=""><strong id="">Winning Hearts and Minds</strong></p><p id="">A concept used in the resolution of war, insurgency, ano other conflicts, to express prevailing not by the use of superior physical force, but by making emotional or intellectual appeals to sway supporters of the other side</p><p id=""><strong id="">Containment</strong></p><p id="">An attempt to contain the enemy, to prevent its further expansion, be it expanding geographically, militarily, or politically</p><p id="">Containing acknowledges that an undesirable event has happened, that you can't easily undo it, and so instead tries to mitigate further loss</p><p id=""><strong id="">Appeasement</strong></p><p id="">Making concessions to opponents in order to avoid direct or further conflict with them</p><p id="">If you are in no position to meaningfully deter or contain an emerging conflict that you’d like to avoid, appeasement may be a necessary evil</p><p id=""><strong id="">Winning A Battle But Losing The War (AKA, a Phyrric Victory)</strong></p><p id="">Refers to achieving a minor victory that ultimately results in a larger defeat, rendering the victory empty or hollow</p><p id="">It can also refer to gaining a small tactical advantage that corresponds to a wider disadvantage</p><p id=""><strong id="">Beachhead</strong></p><p id="">A beachhead is a temporary line that a military unit establishes and holds until reinforcements arrive and they can make an advance</p><p id="">Businesses can use a beachhead by concentrating resources in one small area and succeeding first before moving on to bigger markets</p><p id=""><strong id="">Attrition Warfare</strong></p><p id="">A warfare where the opponents are so strong that an end can only be reached through an extended and mutual depletion of each other’s resources</p><p id="">In these situations, the side with the largest reserves of resources typically wins in the long-run</p><h1 id="">General Thinking Concepts</h1><p id=""><strong id="">Pain, Chemicals And Diseases</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to become confused when we are in pain, under the influence of chemicals or have a physical or mental illness</p><p id="">Before making important decisions, ensure you are free of these influences and your senses are not distorted</p><p id=""><strong id="">Multiple Tendencies</strong></p><p id="">The tendency for multiple psychological biases operating together to lead to irrationality on a tremendous scale</p><p id="">Corporate boards are a great example: Incentive-caused bias, Liking bias, Authority bias, Social Proof Bias, Reciprocation, and many more...</p><p id=""><strong id="">It'll Get Worse Before It Gets Better Fallacy</strong></p><p id="">If someone selling you something tells you this, be wary</p><p id="">If the problem continues to worsen, their prediction is confirmed and you'll believe they're competent. If it improves, they're right and you'll be happy. Either way, they win</p><p id=""><strong id="">Coincidence Effect</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to underestimate the inevitability of unlikely events</p><p id="">Due to the sheer number of events that happen daily, unlikely events are more common than you'd expect</p><p id="">What would be more surprising is if improbable events never came to be</p><p id=""><strong id="">The Anchor</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to be subconsciously influenced by initial data points in settings including negotiations, purchases, or estimates</p><p id="">For example, the “recommended retail price” on a producty or an initial quote for a service may be nothing more than an anchor</p><p id="">Be cautious</p><p id=""><strong id="">Induction</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to assume that because something has happened in the past, it will continue to happen in the future</p><p id="">Inductive thinking can lead to overconfidence and have devastating results</p><p id="">We must remember that certainties are always provisional</p><p id=""><strong id="">Forecast Illusion</strong></p><p id="">Expert predictions aren't as good as we think they are</p><p id="">If they're wrong, they enjoy free reign with few negative consequences because hardly anyone remembers. If they're right, the world will know about it</p><p id="">Analyse track records when assessing predictions</p><p id=""><strong id="">Association Bias</strong></p><p id="">The tendency to see connections where none exist</p><p id="">Example: If we eat a foreign food and feel sick afterward, we avoid it in future</p><p id="">We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it—and stop there</p><p id=""><strong id="">Beginner's Luck</strong></p><p id="">Creating a (false) link with the past based on a positive first-experience</p><p id="">Your first investment in the stock market proves to be a huge success. You believe you have real skill</p><p id="">Bouyed by this confidence, you bet more than you can afford and lose it all</p><p id=""><strong id="">'Because' Justification</strong></p><p id="">The tendency for the simple justification of "because" to be sufficient for encountering more tolerance and helpfulness for our behaviour</p><p id="">A: "Why haven't you done this work yet?" </p><p id="">B: "Because, I haven't got around to it."</p><p id="">A: "Oh, that's okay then!"</p><p id=""><strong id="">Contagion Bias</strong></p><p id="">We avoid contact with people or objects viewed as "contaminated" by previous contact with someone or something viewed as bad</p><p id="">E.g., we view a person who has touched a diseased person as likely to have the disease (regardless of the contagiousness of the disease)</p><p id=""><strong id="">The Problem With Averages</strong></p><p id="">Using averages is troublesome when extreme cases (outliers) dominate the distribution.
