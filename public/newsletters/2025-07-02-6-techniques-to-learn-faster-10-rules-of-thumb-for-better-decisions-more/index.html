@nateliason\nThe ADEPT Method\nA method to teach yourself a difficult idea, or explain one to others.\nIt's called making explanations ADEPT: Use an Analogy, Diagram, Example, Plain-English description, and then a Technical description.\nCreated by @betterexplained.\nSpaced Repetition\nMemories weaken over time.\nIf we learn something new, we remember less and less of it as the days and weeks go by: the forgetting curve.\nThe way to combat this curve is through spaced repetition: repeated exposure to the information to be learned over time.\nChunking\nThe process of taking individual pieces of information and grouping them into larger units to make them easier to remember.\nThe most common example of chunking occurs in phone numbers.\nExample: A sequence of 8-5-4-1-3-2-4-9-8-7 would be chunked into 854-1324-987.\nElaborative Interrogation\nInvolves generating an explanation for why an explicitly stated fact or concept is true.\nIt's asking yourself questions about how and why things work, and then producing the answers to these questions.\nLearning the \"Why\" aids retention significantly.\nThe Textbook Method\nWrite your own textbook chapter on a topic.\nIt requires a deep understanding of the concepts and how they fit together.\nYou're forced to be consise and to create a clear mental structure of the topic.\nThere's no hiding behind knowledge gaps.\n10 rules of thumb for better decisionsTaleb's Hiring Heuristic\nIf presented with two seemingly equal candidates for a role, pick the one with the least label-oriented education.\nThe one with the least label-oriented education has got there in spite of the higher 'credentialisation' of their competitors.\nGrowth Razor\nThe harder the activity, the more likely it will lead to growth.\nThe easier the activity, the more likely it will lead to stagnation.\n1 uncomfortable hour \u003e 10 comfortable hours.\nComfort and growth don't exist in the same room.\nCheckhov's Gun\nWhen telling a story, every element included should be essential.\nIf it's not, don't include it.\n\"One must never place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn't going to go off. It's wrong to make promises you don't mean to keep.\"\nWalt Disney's Imagery\nThe clarity you're seeking comes from a visual.\nComplexity is made simple through drawing.\nHuman's understand and relate to imagery more so than words.\nHere's Walt Disney's drawing that reveals the brilliant strategy behind Disney's lasting success.\nSchwarzeneggers' Wisdom\nIf you're a creative, never be reliant on the job with the biggest payday.\nThis way, you retain your inner joy and pride.\nBefore acting, Arnold made millions from property and bodybuilding so he never had to say yes to acting gigs he didn't want.\nNaval's Razor\nFigure out how much an hour of your time is worth. Your 'aspirational hourly' rate.\nWhen deciding whether or not to do a task, ask whether it's worth more or less than your rate.\nIf it's worth less than your rate, outsource it, automate it, or delete it.\nMunger's Razor\nNever allow yourself to have an opinion unless you can state the other side's argument better than they can.\nThis is the antiodote to confirmation bias.\nDoing the work required to hold an opinion means you can argue against yourself better than others can.\nHitchen's Razor\nWhat can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.\nThe burden of proof regarding the truthfulness of a claim lies with who makes the claim; if it's not met, then the claim is unfounded.\nExtraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\nNewton’s Flaming Laser Sword\nIf a question can't be answered through experiment, it's not worth asking.\nIf something can't be settled by observation, then it's not worthy of debate.\nPick your battles.\nJoe Rogan's Razor\nIf unsure what action to take, act like your life is a movie, and you are the superhero starring in it.\nDo what your kids would one day look back at with pride.\nHow to consistently think criticallyThe following mental models are philosophical razors.\nThese are rules of thumb that help eliminate unlikely explanations for a phenomenon.\nThey're not right 100% of the time, but they are more often than not.\nThey're therefore useful mental shortcuts to make decisions quicker, avoid logical fallacies, and think critically.\nSagan Standard\nExtraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\nIf someone claims that their name is Bob, that's not an extraordinary claim.\nIf someone claims that they saw a UFO, that is extraordinary, and must be backed up by extraordinary evidence to prove it.\nHume’s Razor\nCauses must be sufficiently able to produce the effect assigned to them.\nA fallen power line isn’t enough to cause a national blackout.\nIf a cause isn’t able to produce the observed effect, we must eliminate it or show what needs to be added to create the effect.\nPopper’s Falsifiability Principle\nFor a theory to be considered scientific, it must be possible to disprove or refute it.\nExample: \"All swans are white.\"\nIf you find one black swan, you would falsify this theory.\nClaims that are unfalsifiable should usually be dismissed.\nGrice’s Razor\nAddress what the speaker actually meant, instead of addressing the literal meaning of what they actually said.\nDon’t take everything someone says literally and get into silly arguments over semantics or minor details, whilst completely missing the main point.\nDuck Test\nIf it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.\nIf something seems a certain way, it probably is that way.\nAppearances can deceive, but there's generally no need to deny reality.\nUsually, what you see is what you get.\nTarzwell's Razor\nHigh emotion leads to high bias.\nBoth science and the justice system hold that dispassion is at the core of their intentions.\n”Where there is passion the truth cannot be trusted.”\n—James Tarzwell\n10 common logical fallaciesAppeal to Authority\nClaiming that because an authority or someone of status thinks something, it therefore must be true.\nAuthority or status holds no bearing upon whether claims are true or not.\nAssess the argument, not the origin of the argument.\nComposition or Division Fallacy\nArguing that because something is true of individual components, it is also true of the whole (or vice versa).\nYou believe that you can save more by spending less, and then assume that the economy as a whole can save more by spending less.\nCircular Argument\nRestating a claim instead of giving any back-up or factual evidence.\nIgnoring any question being asked by answering it in multiple different ways.\nExample: \"You should invite your uncle to the wedding because it would be mean not to invite him.\"\nAppeal To Nature\nClaiming that because something is 'natural' it must be valid or good.\nExamples:\n1/ “Antibiotics are unnatural, so they're bad for you.”\n2/ “Herbal medicine is natural, so it's good for you.”\n'Naturalness' alone doesn't make something good or bad.\nBlack or White Thinking (Either/or Thinking)\nClaiming that only two alternative states can be true, when in fact more possibilities exist.\nExample: Putting someone in a 'good' or 'bad' category, without accounting for nuance or situational factors that influence behaviour.\nPlain Folks Fallacy\nWhen someone attempts to convince an audience that they, and their ideas, are “of the people” and that they are an Average Joe.\nThey try to convince the audience that they share common goals and should therefore agree with them.\nPoisoning the Well\nPresenting negative information that is irrelevant before presenting an argument, which makes that argument, or person, seem untrustworthy.\n\"Before you listen to what he has to say, may I remind you that he has been in jail.\"\nAlso called a smear tactic.\nAppeal to Consequences\nA type of appeal to emotion.\nIt's an argument that attempts to prove a premise true or false because the consequences of it being true or false are desirable or undesirable.\nThe desirability of a premise's consequence does not make it true or false.\nLoki’s Wager\nThe unreasonable insistence that a concept cannot be defined, and therefore cannot be discussed.\nCan be used to avoid contentious arguments entirely and 'kick' the can down the road.\nAvoiding it is critical to making decisions rather than twisting in semantics.\nHasty Generalisation\nClosely related to stereotyping, it involves generalising based on general rules from a sample set of data.\nIt's when someone makes a claim based on evidence that is too small to be conclusive.\nYou can't make a claim based on only one or two examples.\nActive ReadingInvolves reading with the purpose of understanding the material deeply and retaining the information.\nIt's the difference between building real knowledge and chaffeur knowledge.\nDon't read for vanity metrics, read to understand deeply.\nRibot's LawNewer memories are more susceptible to aging than older memories.\nEach time we think about a memory, we integrate it more deeply into our existing web of memories and make it less likely to be dislodged.\nLesson: Attach new memories to old memories for retention.\nElaborative EncodingA method to make new information more memorable.\nInvolves making new information elaborate and complex by relating it to existing knowledge.\nThis activates more parts of the brain and interlinks the information, making it less likely to be forgotten.\nExample: You're meeting a person for the first time and need to remember their name.\nYou want to remember the last name Fisher.\nYou envision the person wearing a silly fish hat and holding a reel as you repeat their name internally.\nThis is elaborative encoding.\nThe Forgetting CurveMemories weaken over time.\nIf we learn something new, but then make no attempt to relearn that information, we remember less and less of it as the hours, days and weeks go by.\nThe way to combat this curve is through spaced repetition.\nImposter SyndromeOccurs when you feel you don't deserve all you've achieved, or that you're going to be exposed as less talented than your surroundings suggest about you.\nSurveys indicate 70% of people experience it in their careers.\nBaker/baker ParadoxA researcher shows two groups the same photo of a face and tells one that the guy is a baker and the other that his last name is Baker.\nDays later, the researcher shows the same groups the same photo and asks for the accompanying word.\nWhat happens next?\nThe group who was told the man's profession, baker, is much more likely to remember it than the person who was given his surname.\nWhy should that be?\nSame photo.\nSame word.\nDifferent retention of the memory.\nWhen you hear that the man in the photo is a baker, that fact gets embedded in a whole network of ideas about what it means to be a baker.\nHe cooks bread.\nHe wears a big white hat.\nHe smells good when he comes home from work.\nOn the other hand, the name Baker is only connected to a memory of the person's face.\nThere are less links or strings attached, making it harder to 'reel' the memory back in.\nRemembering more is about figuring out how to turn capital \"B\" Bakers into lowercase \"b\" bakers.\nHow can we do this?\n1/ Attach new memories to old memories\n2/ Make information vivid and exciting\n3/ Engage as many senses as possible\n4/ We don't remember all types of information equally—visual and spatial are best—so aim to activate these senses when possible\nCurse of KnowledgeOnce we know something, we assume everyone else knows it, too.\nIt's why some experts can't explain their field simply.\nAnd why people don't share knowledge that could benefit others.\nRemember: There are always people to teach and people to learn from.\nThat's it!

unfounded.</p><p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</p><p><strong>Newton’s Flaming Laser Sword</strong></p><p>If a question can't be answered through experiment, it's not worth asking.</p><p>If something can't be settled by observation, then it's not worthy of debate.</p><p>Pick your battles.</p><p><strong>Joe Rogan's Razor</strong></p><p>If unsure what action to take, act like your life is a movie, and you are the superhero starring in it.</p><p>Do what your kids would one day look back at with pride.</p><h1>How to consistently think critically</h1><p>The following mental models are philosophical razors.</p><p>These are rules of thumb that help eliminate unlikely explanations for a phenomenon.</p><p>They're not right 100% of the time, but they are more often than not.</p><p>They're therefore useful mental shortcuts to make decisions quicker, avoid logical fallacies, and think critically.</p><p><strong>Sagan Standard</strong></p><p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</p><p>If someone claims that their name is Bob, that's not an extraordinary claim.</p><p>If someone claims that they saw a UFO, that is extraordinary, and must be backed up by extraordinary evidence to prove it.</p><p><strong>Hume’s Razor</strong></p><p>Causes must be sufficiently able to produce the effect assigned to them.</p><p>A fallen power line isn’t enough to cause a national blackout.</p><p>If a cause isn’t able to produce the observed effect, we must eliminate it or show what needs to be added to create the effect.</p><p><strong>Popper’s Falsifiability Principle</strong></p><p>For a theory to be considered scientific, it must be possible to disprove or refute it.</p><p>Example: "All swans are white."</p><p>If you find one black swan, you would falsify this theory.</p><p>Claims that are unfalsifiable should usually be dismissed.</p><p><strong>Grice’s Razor</strong></p><p>Address what the speaker actually meant, instead of addressing the literal meaning of what they actually said.</p><p>Don’t take everything someone says literally and get into silly arguments over semantics or minor details, whilst completely missing the main point.</p><p><strong>Duck Test</strong></p><p>If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.</p><p>If something seems a certain way, it probably is that way.</p><p>Appearances can deceive, but there's generally no need to deny reality.</p><p>Usually, what you see is what you get.</p><p><strong>Tarzwell's Razor</strong></p><p>High emotion leads to high bias.</p><p>Both science and the justice system hold that dispassion is at the core of their intentions.</p><p>”Where there is passion the truth cannot be trusted.”</p><p>—James Tarzwell</p><h1>10 common logical fallacies</h1><p><strong>Appeal to Authority</strong></p><p>Claiming that because an authority or someone of status thinks something, it therefore must be true.</p><p>Authority or status holds no bearing upon whether claims are true or not.</p><p>Assess the argument, not the origin of the argument.</p><p><strong>Composition or Division Fallacy</strong></p><p>Arguing that because something is true of individual components, it is also true of the whole (or vice versa).</p><p>You believe that you can save more by spending less, and then assume that the economy as a whole can save more by spending less.</p><p><strong>Circular Argument</strong></p><p>Restating a claim instead of giving any back-up or factual evidence.</p><p>Ignoring any question being asked by answering it in multiple different ways.</p><p>Example: "You should invite your uncle to the wedding because it would be mean not to invite him."</p><p><strong>Appeal To Nature</strong></p><p>Claiming that because something is 'natural' it must be valid or good.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>1/ “Antibiotics are unnatural, so they're bad for you.”</p><p>2/ “Herbal medicine is natural, so it's good for you.”</p><p>'Naturalness' alone doesn't make something good or bad.</p><p><strong>Black or White Thinking (Either/or Thinking)</strong></p><p>Claiming that only two alternative states can be true, when in fact more possibilities exist.</p><p>Example: Putting someone in a 'good' or 'bad' category, without accounting for nuance or situational factors that influence behaviour.</p><p><strong>Plain Folks Fallacy</strong></p><p>When someone attempts to convince an audience that they, and their ideas, are “of the people” and that they are an Average Joe.</p><p>They try to convince the audience that they share common goals and should therefore agree with them.</p><p><strong>Poisoning the Well</strong></p><p>Presenting negative information that is irrelevant before presenting an argument, which makes that argument, or person, seem untrustworthy.</p><p>"Before you listen to what he has to say, may I remind you that he has been in jail."</p><p>Also called a smear tactic.</p><p><strong>Appeal to Consequences</strong></p><p>A type of appeal to emotion.</p><p>It's an argument that attempts to prove a premise true or false because the consequences of it being true or false are desirable or undesirable.</p><p>The desirability of a premise's consequence does not make it true or false.</p><p><strong>Loki’s Wager</strong></p><p>The unreasonable insistence that a concept cannot be defined, and therefore cannot be discussed.</p><p>Can be used to avoid contentious arguments entirely and 'kick' the can down the road.</p><p>Avoiding it is critical to making decisions rather than twisting in semantics.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"

Law</h1><p>Newer memories are more susceptible to aging than older memories.</p><p>Each time we think about a memory, we integrate it more deeply into our existing web of memories and make it less likely to be dislodged.</p><p>Lesson: Attach new memories to old memories for retention.</p><h1>Elaborative Encoding</h1><p>A method to make new information more memorable.</p><p>Involves making new information elaborate and complex by relating it to existing knowledge.</p><p>This activates more parts of the brain and interlinks the information, making it less likely to be forgotten.</p><p>Example: You're meeting a person for the first time and need to remember their name.</p><p>You want to remember the last name Fisher.</p><p>You envision the person wearing a silly fish hat and holding a reel as you repeat their name internally.</p><p>This is elaborative encoding.</p><h1>The Forgetting Curve</h1><p>Memories weaken over time.</p><p>If we learn something new, but then make no attempt to relearn that information, we remember less and less of it as the hours, days and weeks go by.</p><p>The way to combat this curve is through spaced repetition.</p><h1>Imposter Syndrome</h1><p>Occurs when you feel you don't deserve all you've achieved, or that you're going to be exposed as less talented than your surroundings suggest about you.</p><p>Surveys indicate 70% of people experience it in their careers.</p><h1>Baker/baker Paradox</h1><p>A researcher shows two groups the same photo of a face and tells one that the guy is a baker and the other that his last name is Baker.</p><p>Days later, the researcher shows the same groups the same photo and asks for the accompanying word.</p><p>What happens next?</p><p>The group who was told the man's profession, baker, is much more likely to remember it than the person who was given his surname.</p><p>Why should that be?</p><p>Same photo.</p><p>Same word.</p><p>Different retention of the memory.</p><p>When you hear that the man in the photo is a baker, that fact gets embedded in a whole network of ideas about what it means to be a baker.</p><p>He cooks bread.</p><p>He wears a big white hat.</p><p>He smells good when he comes home from work.</p><p>On the other hand, the name Baker is only connected to a memory of the person's face.</p><p>There are less links or strings attached, making it harder to 'reel' the memory back in.</p><p>Remembering more is about figuring out how to turn capital "B" Bakers into lowercase "b" bakers.</p><p>How can we do this?</p><p>1/ Attach new memories to old memories</p><p>2/ Make information vivid and exciting</p><p>3/ Engage as many senses as possible</p><p>4/ We don't remember all types of information equally—visual and spatial are best—so aim to activate these senses when possible</p><h1>Curse of Knowledge</h1><p>Once we know something, we assume everyone else knows it, too.</p><p>It's why some experts can't explain their field simply.</p><p>And why people don't share knowledge that could benefit others.</p><p>Remember: There are always people to teach and people to learn from.</p><h1>That's it!
