I really appreciate your support over the course of the year, and am excited to announce a few improvements to the Newsletter (with a few more exciting ones in the works...so stay tuned!).¬†Update #1: Name change of Newsletter to \"A Players\" from \"Mental Models, Concepts, and Frameworks\"\nWhilst this Newsletter was titled \"Mental Models, Concepts, and Frameworks\", the underlying purpose of the content shared has always been constant: Explore how to get better at the game of life‚Äîwhether through better thinking, better frameworks, or better tools.¬†For those unfamiliar with the term, \"A Players\", it's commonly used to describe the top 10% of performers in a given field or company. More importantly, though, it's an ethos that describes someone who is insatiably curious and hungry to improve their outcomes, and the outcomes of those around them. To rise to the top of whatever \"game\"‚Äîcreative, business, sporting, or otherwise‚Äîthey're playing and bring those beside them along for the ride.¬†The aim of my content is simply to help you do that. Mental models, concepts, and frameworks will remain a core pillar going forward, but we'll explore other areas that lead to this end goal. As such, \"A Players\" is a fitting name to capture the essence of the Newsletter and to continue to attract a like-minded community (it also happens to be the first letter of my name...I promise it's a coincidence!).\nUpdate #2: Addition of üîó¬†Favourite links of the week üîó\nYou'll notice at the end of this Newsletter a new section, called \"Favourite links of the week.\"\nIn the spirit of inducing curiosity and continual learning, I'll be sharing the most interesting resources, articles, and links I find online on a weekly basis.\nIf you ever find interesting content that I should include, don't hesitate to send it my way!\nUpdate #3: Launch of Talent Collective¬†I'm kicking off a new way to find jobs without the noise typical on LinkedIn, where you often get contacted for positions you'd never consider.¬†If you're looking for new opportunities, apply here to be added to my upcoming talent directory.¬†You'll get opportunities from companies vetted by me‚Äîincluding Figma, Stripe, Coinbase, Brex, Peloton, Affirm, Amazon, Paypal, and many more. It's completely free for candidates. There's no obligations. The directory is curated by me, invite-only and you can be public or anonymous.¬†My goal is to help you find your next great role.¬†If you're in the market for a new gig, head over to A Players and apply!\nUpdate #4: Newsletter date/time change\nFrom next week onwards, you'll receive this newsletter at Saturday morning US ET 9am.\nThis change is to allow better access to the content for those busy during the week.¬†That's the updates for now, but stay tuned for more in the coming weeks.¬†Let's get into this weeks models!\n10 mental models that will make you smarterSystems vs. GoalsTo achieve more, focus on the process first‚Äîthe system‚Äîthat will get you to the goal.\nDoing something every day is a system‚Äîlike writing for 1 hour.\nWriting a book is a goal.\n\"Goals determine your direction.
