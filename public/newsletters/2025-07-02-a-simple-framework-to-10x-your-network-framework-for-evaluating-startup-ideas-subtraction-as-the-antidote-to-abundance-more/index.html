But, this is the exception. Not the rule.\nIt takes extraordinary intellect or skill to succeed while being a bad person.\nFor those of us with a heart, the only choice is to succeed by helping others.\nThere is no faster or more effective way to change your interactions and build relationships.\nYou'll be viewed as a helpful, constructive, positive, and dependable person.\nPeople will think you are more thoughtful, attentive, and understanding.\nPeople will think of you for job opportunities.\nPeople will think of you for investment opportunities.\nPeople will think of you when they need someone they can trust.\nPeople will tell other people all of these things which enhances your reputation even further.\nThat's why thinking \"help this person\" is not altruistic; it's selfish.\nSelfish in the best sense of the word.\nThe single best way to help yourself is to always be looking for ways to help other people.\nIt just so happens that this also makes the world a better place.\nWhat makes this framework difficult:\nIt doesn't always have an immediate payoff.\nYou could spend months with this approach and not receive any benefit.\nAnd so it is with all great habits, their gratification is delayed.\nThe key is trusting the principle of reciprocity.\nThe 'Times' change.

You iterate from an initial product.\nMVT = take your time to discover a strategy but once you have one, move forward with conviction. You build with confidence.\nWhat's wrong with MVP's?1/ MVP’s overemphasize building\nNew products don’t succeed because of the number of features they provide.\nThey succeed because of one core insight that customers actually care about.\nMVT's focus the attention on this core insight and not features.\n2/ MVP’s cause founders to obsess about customer opinion\nCustomers rarely know what they really want, and even if they do, they’ll want different things.\nIf you rely on customers, you’ll build incremental improvements instead of a novel breakthrough.\n3/ MVPs are often overbuilt and make horrible core products\nOnce you start writing code with an MVP, you start to add technical and product debt.\nIf instead, you run an MVT, you start from a fresh slate and are actually building the longer-term vision.\nSo, what does starting a company look like with a MVT?1/ Immerse yourself in a new industry\n2/ Determine your user's jobs-to-be-done\n3/ Identify your value proposition: what promise can you make to help a user with their jobs-to-be done?\nNow, it's time for the MVT—not MVP.\nThe Minimum Viable Testing Framework1/ List the riskiest assumptions that might lead your business to succeed or fail:\nWhy might this not work?\nRiskiest assumptions commonly include:\nBuilding something people don’t want (test: force people to pay)Execution risk (harder in reality than theory)Marketing/Distribution (can you reach users)Market sizeProfitability2/ Test your assumptions through Minimum Viable Tests:\nDetermine if your idea actually works in reality.\nPick your riskiest assumption and devise a specific test for that assumption.\nThere is no specific 'prescription' for how to do this because it depends on the nature of the company, industry, and specific risks.\nThis is where creativity is required.\nHere, it's critical to disregard the future state of what the solution might look like.\nInstead, focus on the lowest risk and cost solution you can deliver in the shortest possible timeframe.\nThis will often involve leveraging assets—just like AirBnB did—you already have.\nOnce you've tested enough risky assumptions to have more confidence about your product viability, it's time to build an initial product.\nWith the help of your target customers, iterate on the product until you have nailed product/market fit.\nThen, it's time to scale!\nIf you'd like a deeper dive on the MVT process, I highly recommend reading Gagan's initial article:\nThe Minimum Viable Testing Process for Evaluating Startup Ideas | First Round Review — review.firstround.com\nThe traditional approach is to do some customer research, throw an MVP out there as fast as possible, and hope it hits. After being early at three startups that achieved over $1M in run-rate in their first six months of going live, Gagan Biyani has landed on an approach that’s quite different. Here’s his framework.\nSubtraction as the antidote to abundanceAchieving more in less time requires better mental models.\nForget all the productivity advice you've heard.\nFocus on one thing: Minimising distractions.\nTurn off notifications.\nQuiten your environment.\nDelete social media apps.\nBlock distracting websites.\nLeave your phone in another room.\nThe 10:10:10 StrategyBefore making an important decision, ask:\nHow will I feel 10 minutes from now?10 months from now?10 years from now?This will force you to think about the longer term impact of what's facing you.\nDon’t make decisions based on immediate gratification.\nFour simple principles to avoid bad decisionsConsider Unintended ConsequencesBefore making a decision, ask, \"What are the possible unplanned outcomes that could occur?\"\nFocus on the possible second-order effects—can you live with ALL of them?\n“We make choices, but we don't always choose the consequences.” Sean Covey\nPreserve OptionalityMake choices that preserve future options or, when you have a decision, delay deciding until you have the most information possible.\nThis allows you to keep your options open until you have higher certainty over the best path.\nThat path will be yours.\nAvoid Short-TermismShort-termism is an excessive focus on short-term results at the expense of long-term interests.\nAn example is how Company's prioritise quarterly earnings over long-term innovation.\nWhere possible, make decisions that are optimal for the long-term.\nPrecautionary PrincipleA strategy for dealing with decisions where taking no action at all is better than a bad or unintended result from action.\nIt's pausing to increase the certainty that a decision will be safe.\n“Precaution is better than cure.” Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\nThat's it!

target=_blank>@Gaganbiyani</a> knows a thing or two about finding great startup ideas.</p><p><strong>Here's the framework he uses to evaluate startup ideas:</strong></p><p>The traditional approach in startups is that you can't predict whether people will want your product.</p><p>So, you build a 'Minimum Viable Product' as fast as possible to see if users find value in the idea.</p><p>If they don't, you iterate until they do.</p><p>This isn't Gagan's approach.</p><p>Instead, Gagan uses 'Minimum Viable Testing.'</p><p>An MVT is a test of a critical hypothesis—something that must be right for the company to stand a chance.</p><p>For example, AirBnB had to be right that strangers would pay to stay in others' homes, or else the business fails.</p><p>So, rather than building any software, they tested this assumption in the simplest manner possible.</p><p>They provided air mattresses in their living room, free wifi, and breakfast to attendees of an upcoming conference (where all the hotels were booked out).</p><p>The team were able to validate—with real-world data, minimal risk and cost—that people were willing to stay with strangers.</p><p>In fact, this model allowed travellers to have a unique, personable experience with the city and other like-minded people.</p><p>The rest is history.</p><h2>So, how does an MVT compare to an MVP?</h2><p>MVP = a basic early version of a product that looks and feels like a simplified version of the eventual vision.</p><p>MVT = a specific test of an assumption that must be true for the business to succeed.</p><h2>How do the strategies differ?</h2><p>MVP = there is no strategy: you throw things at the wall until it sticks. You iterate from an initial product.</p><p>MVT = take your time to discover a strategy but once you have one, move forward with conviction. You build with confidence.</p><h2>What's wrong with MVP's?</h2><p><strong>1/ MVP’s overemphasize building</strong></p><p>New products don’t succeed because of the number of features they provide.</p><p>They succeed because of one core insight that customers actually care about.</p><p>MVT's focus the attention on this core insight and not features.</p><p><strong>2/ MVP’s cause founders to obsess about customer opinion</strong></p><p>Customers rarely know what they really want, and even if they do, they’ll want different things.</p><p>If you rely on customers, you’ll build incremental improvements instead of a novel breakthrough.</p><p><strong>3/ MVPs are often overbuilt and make horrible core products</strong></p><p>Once you start writing code with an MVP, you start to add technical and product debt.</p><p>If instead, you run an MVT, you start from a fresh slate and are actually building the longer-term vision.</p><h2><strong>So, what does starting a company look like with a MVT?</strong></h2><p>1/ Immerse yourself in a new industry</p><p>2/ Determine your user's jobs-to-be-done</p><p>3/ Identify your value proposition: what promise can you make to help a user with their jobs-to-be done?</p><p>Now, it's time for the MVT—not MVP.</p><h2>The Minimum Viable Testing Framework</h2><p><strong>1/ List the riskiest assumptions that might lead your business to succeed or fail:</strong></p><p>Why might this not work?</p><p>Riskiest assumptions commonly include:</p><ol><li>Building something people don’t want (test: force people to pay)</li><li>Execution risk (harder in reality than theory)</li><li>Marketing/Distribution (can you reach users)</li><li>Market size</li><li>Profitability</li></ol><p><strong>2/ Test your assumptions through Minimum Viable Tests:</strong></p><p>Determine if your idea actually works in reality.</p><p>Pick your riskiest assumption and devise a specific test for that assumption.</p><p>There is no specific 'prescription' for how to do this because it depends on the nature of the company, industry, and specific risks.</p><p>This is where creativity is required.</p><p>Here, it's critical to disregard the future state of what the solution might look like.</p><p>Instead, focus on the lowest risk and cost solution you can deliver in the shortest possible timeframe.</p><p>This will often involve leveraging assets—just like AirBnB did—you already have.</p><p>Once you've tested enough risky assumptions to have more confidence about your product viability, it's time to build an initial product.</p><p>With the help of your target customers, iterate on the product until you have nailed product/market fit.</p><p>Then, it's time to scale!</p><p>If you'd like a deeper dive on the MVT process, I highly recommend reading Gagan's initial article:</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type=image data-rt-align=center><div><img src=https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640fac937975fd346ae8a47a_firstround_2FGettyImages-1297057690.jpeg width=auto height=auto loading=auto></div></figure><p><a href=https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Jldmlldy5maXJzdHJvdW5kLmNvbS90aGUtbWluaW11bS12aWFibGUtdGVzdGluZy1wcm9jZXNzLWZvci1ldmFsdWF0aW5nLXN0YXJ0dXAtaWRlYXM_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPU1lbnRhbCUyME1vZGVscyUyQyUyMENvbmNlcHRzJTJDJTIwYW5kJTIwRnJhbWV3b3JrcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9UmV2dWUlMjBuZXdzbGV0dGVyI2ludHJvZHVjdGlvbiUyM2ludHJvZHVjdGlvbiIsInBvc3RfaWQiOiJmYzI5NGIyNC1lZjNmLTRhNDUtYjI5OC1lZDE0NTM3ZmU2NDQiLCJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbl9pZCI6IjEzN2Q1ZTgzLTk1MDMtNGRiNy1hOGM0LWYzNDE1YzIwNTVhZSIsInZpc2l0X3Rva2VuIjoiN2NiN2I3ZTUtOTEyNS00NDJmLWI4YjgtMjdjZGMxNTJhZGJiIiwiaWF0IjoxNjc4NzA1NjMzLjg0MiwiaXNzIjoib3JjaGlkIn0.iN5U4uU4C8Bs4oBFkocVZ6__icxhRpSfirRrQITcpbw target=_blank><strong>The Minimum Viable Testing Process for Evaluating Startup Ideas | First Round Review</strong></a><strong> — </strong><a href=https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Jldmlldy5maXJzdHJvdW5kLmNvbS90aGUtbWluaW11bS12aWFibGUtdGVzdGluZy1wcm9jZXNzLWZvci1ldmFsdWF0aW5nLXN0YXJ0dXAtaWRlYXMjaW50cm9kdWN0aW9uJTIzaW50cm9kdWN0aW9uIiwicG9zdF9pZCI6ImZjMjk0YjI0LWVmM2YtNGE0NS1iMjk4LWVkMTQ1MzdmZTY0NCIsInB1YmxpY2F0aW9uX2lkIjoiMTM3ZDVlODMtOTUwMy00ZGI3LWE4YzQtZjM0MTVjMjA1NWFlIiwidmlzaXRfdG9rZW4iOiI3Y2I3YjdlNS05MTI1LTQ0MmYtYjhiOC0yN2NkYzE1MmFkYmIiLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzg3MDU2MzMuODQyLCJpc3MiOiJvcmNoaWQifQ.AH3oXx-esvDhgGOqRjCc0JuQS15glBIEISNg9A4Rb_0 target=_blank><strong>review.firstround.com</strong></a></p><p>The traditional approach is to do some customer research, throw an MVP out there as fast as possible, and hope it hits. After being early at three startups that achieved over $1M in run-rate in their first six months of going live, Gagan Biyani has landed on an approach that’s quite different. Here’s his framework.</p><h1>Subtraction as the antidote to abundance</h1><p>Achieving more in less time requires better mental models.</p><p>Forget all the productivity advice you've heard.</p><p>Focus on one thing: Minimising distractions.</p><p>Turn off notifications.</p><p>Quiten your environment.</p><p>Delete social media apps.</p><p>Block distracting websites.</p><p>Leave your phone in another room.</p><h1>The 10:10:10 Strategy</h1><p>Before making an important decision, ask:</p><ul><li>How will I feel 10 minutes from now?</li><li>10 months from now?</li><li>10 years from now?</li></ul><p>This will force you to think about the longer term impact of what's facing you.</p><p>Don’t make decisions based on immediate gratification.</p><h1>Four simple principles to avoid bad decisions</h1><h2><strong>Consider Unintended Consequences</strong></h2><p>Before making a decision, ask, "What are the possible unplanned outcomes that could occur?"</p><p>Focus on the possible second-order effects—can you live with ALL of them?</p><p>“We make choices, but we don't always choose the consequences.” Sean Covey</p><h2><strong>Preserve Optionality</strong></h2><p>Make choices that preserve future options or, when you have a decision, delay deciding until you have the most information possible.</p><p>This allows you to keep your options open until you have higher certainty over the best path.</p><p>That path will be yours.</p><h2>Avoid Short-Termism</h2><p>Short-termism is an excessive focus on short-term results at the expense of long-term interests.</p><p>An example is how Company's prioritise quarterly earnings over long-term innovation.</p><p>Where possible, make decisions that are optimal for the long-term.</p><h2>Precautionary Principle</h2><p>A strategy for dealing with decisions where taking no action at all is better than a bad or unintended result from action.</p><p>It's pausing to increase the certainty that a decision will be safe.</p><p>“Precaution is better than cure.” Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</p><h1>That's it!
