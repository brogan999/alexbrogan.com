Across a broad range of topics. Whenever I find something worth reading or that I‚Äôd like to refer to in the future, I save it. I‚Äôve done this for many years. What‚Äôs resulted is a long-list of high-quality, curated resources (800+) across my areas of interest and areas I‚Äôve sought answers to in the past (and continue to seek answers to). I've finally got around to categorising these resources and for the first-time, I'm sharing it with my subscribers‚Äîyou are the very first 100 people to receive access to it.\nGood answers shouldn‚Äôt be hard to find, and there are usually shortcuts to achieving what you want to‚Äîall it takes is the right advice, at the right time.\nThe majority of these resources are crowdsourced from some of the best minds in the world‚ÄîI‚Äôve simply curated them. This will be a living, breathing database, and I wholly welcome any recommendations you have to make it better. A Crowdsourced List Of The Best Resources On The Internet\nCategories include: Being effective, communication, learning advice, mental models, career advice, and many more.\nI hope you get as much value from it as I have!\nAlso, the resources are designed to be shared, so if you know anyone who would find it helpful, please feel free to share them.\nNow, to this weeks mental models.We again covered 60 mental models (concepts and biases) from psychology and general thinking.\nSome highlights include:\nCognitive Scope LimitationBucket ErrorLaw of Narrative GravityAnthropomorphismMagic Number (7+-2)As always, if you get value out of this, I‚Äôd appreciate you sharing it or my Twitter profile on Twitter so others can get value out of it too :)\nWithout further ado, let‚Äôs get into it!\nPsychology \u0026 General Thinking ConceptsPattern Matching\nThe tendency of our brain to associate new patterns with old patterns that are stored in memory\nPattern matching has a huge influence on decision making across diverse fields. When possible, we should check our pattern matching against objective information\nMental Simulation\nOur mind‚Äôs ability to imagine taking a specific action and simulating the probable result before acting\nHow often do you use your imagination to simulate the results of specific actions or goals? This improves our ability to solve the problems in front of us\nInterpretation and Reinterpretation\nWhen there‚Äôs not enough information to develop an accurate pattern, we rely on prior information to make interpretations\nReinterpration involves changing your beliefs about a past event‚Äîit's a powerful tool to overcome negative experiences\nMotivation\nAn emotional state that links the parts of your brain that feel with the parts responsible for action\nMotivation results from no conflict or confusion over the best course of action‚Äîit can involve moving towards something desirable or away from something undesirable\nInhibition\nThe ability to temporarily override our natural inclinations (habits)\nWillpower is the fuel of Inhibition. Whenever we inhibit our natural responses to our environment, willpower is at work\nHowever, we only have limited willpower, so must use inhibition sparingly\nStatus Signals\nTangible indicators of an intangible quality that increases a person's status or group affiliation. Rare or expensive items, awards, honors, etc.\nWhenever possible, we should avoid playing \"status\" games, and do things that are intrinsically motivating to us\nStatus Malfunction\nThe more attractive an option looks in terms of \"status\", the more likely it is to have drawbacks, and the more likely you are to ignore those drawbacks and pursue that option anyway\nBe willing to ignore shiny distractions for meaningful work\nThreat Lockdown (Fight-or-flight response)\nA heightened protective mode your mind and body enter when they sense an impending external threat\nTo overcome this mode, we must convince our mind that the threat no longer exists or never truly existed to the extent we believed\nCognitive Scope Limitation\nOur minds tendency to simplify reality in the face of overwhelming information. Can lead to suboptimal decisions as we fail to consider the full \"scope\" of the issue\n‚ÄúOne death is a tragedy. A million deaths is a statistic.‚Äù‚ÄîKurt Tucholsky\nAssociation\nThe tendency of the human mind to store information contextually. We constantly look for patterns, even when they don't exist, this can lead to associations forming between things that aren't logically connected\nAbsence Blindness\nWhen you don‚Äôt notice or pay attention to things that are going well\nExample: We tend to notice referee's only when they perform poorly\nTo judge fairly, we should be conscious of this bias and ensure we pay as much attention to good work as bad work\nNovelty\nNovelty is the presence of new sensory data. Human attention needs novelty to sustain itself\nNovelty is paramount if you want to attract and maintain attention over a long period of time\nContinue offering something new, and people will keep paying attention\nFalse Precision (Roughly Right \u003e Precisely Wrong)\nOccurs when numerical data is presented in a manner that implies better precision than is justified\nIt's the belief that greater precision implies greater accuracy\nAre you getting more useful data or just more data in general?\nWeber-Fechner Law\nWe tend to only perceive a change in a stimulus from any sense (sight, hearing, taste, touch, smell) if that change is at least equal to the pre-existing stimulus\nCan you notice which half (left or right) increased in number of dots?\nCongruence Bias\nThe tendency to over-rely on testing an initial hypothesis while neglecting to test alternative hypotheses\nThat is, people rarely try experiments that could disprove their initial belief, but rather try to repeat their initial results (form of confirmation bias)\nContinued Influence Effect\nExposure to misinformation continues to impact belief and reasoning, even if that misinformation has been corrected\nThis effect is highly relevant in today's world of persistent fake news and misinformation‚Äîdon't believe everything you see and hear\nBucket Error\nWhen multiple different concepts or variables are incorrectly lumped together in one's mind as a single concept/variable\nYou believe you can only become a writer if you don't make spelling mistakes; however, the two concepts are in fact separate variables\nLaw of Narrative Gravity\nThe public and press are drawn to narratives, and the more widely accepted a narrative, the more it attracts and shapes the perception of facts\nExplains why it's critical to shape your own narrative as a company or individual before others do\nAnecdotal Fallacy\nThe tendency to use a personal experience or an isolated example instead of a sound argument or compelling evidence\nQuantitative scientific measures are almost always more accurate than personal perceptions and experiences\nMasked Man Fallacy\nA fallacy of inferring that since one knows (or does not know) something by one description, one must know (or not know) it by another\n\"I know who my father is. I do not know who the masked man is. Therefore, my father is not the masked man.‚Äù\nRecency Illusion\nThe belief that things you have noticed only recently are in fact recent‚Äîor have only just come into existence\n\"Whoa, that's new to me. It must be new to the world!\"\nWhen we think something is new, we treat it as new, and therefore miss important context\nAnthropomorphism\nThe attribution of human traits, emotions, or intentions to non-human things‚Äîit helps us make sense of the behaviours and events we encounter\nHowever, perceiving the presence of human qualities in other entities can be misleading when such qualities are absent\nEssentialism\nThe belief that groups of people, such as men and women, have different basic characteristics that cannot be changed and that are necessary to their identity\nBeware of this belief as it can lead to rigid thinking and perception of our surrounding environment\nCheerleader Effect\nThe cognitive bias which causes people to think individuals are more attractive when they are in a group\nArises from a tendency of the mind to not process every individual detail they perceive, but rather summarise or categorise information as a group\nMental Accounting\nA tendency to place different values on the same amount of money, based on subjective criteria, often with detrimental results\nHelps explain why people are willing to spend more when they pay with a credit card than cash\nAppeal To Probability Fallacy\nAsserting that since something is probably the case, it is certainly the case\n‚ÄúIf I keep doing this long enough, I will probably succeed; therefore, I will succeed.‚Äù\nMagic Number (7+-2)\nThe average person can only keep 7 ¬± 2 items in their short-term working memory\nHumans can process finite information. Information overload will lead to distraction that negatively affects performance\nWhen conveying information, limit it to the essentials\nSwimmer's Body Illusion\nConfusing traits with results\nWe think we can get the body of a professional swimmer by swimming a lot.\nIn truth, the swimmer is able to reach a professional level due to already having the ‚Äòright‚Äô body\nWe should identify and play to our strengths\nStreetlight Effect\nPeople tend to get their information from where it‚Äôs easiest to look\nE.g. We use the first page of Google search results for the majority of research regrdless of how factual the results are. Cumulatively, this can skew knowlege in an entire field\nPlanning Fallacy\nA tendency to underestimate the time it will take to complete a future task, despite knowledge that previous tasks have taken longer than planned\nOccurs due to an optimisim bias\nSelf-Consistency Bias\nThe commonly held idea that we are more consistent in our attitudes, opinions, and beliefs than we actually are\nExample: being unable to see the changes in your thoughts/opinions because you're sure you've always thought the same way\nThe Diderot Effect\nThe tendency for obtaining a new possession to create a spiral of consumption that leads you to acquire more new things\nWe end up buying things that our previous selves never needed to feel happy or fulfilled\nSeek to simplify or eliminate; not consume more\nPremack Principle\nThe tendency for a more desirable or higher probability behaviour to enforce a less desirable or lower probability behaviour\nYou are a child. You want to play a video game. You're only allowed to play if you eat your vegetables. Result? You eat your vegetables\nLake Wobegone Effect\nThe tendency for most people to believe that they are above average in achievement's or capabilities\nResearch has repeatedly shown support for this tendency, but, mathematically speaking, it can't be true\nAssess yourself honestly. Humility breeds growth\nEffort Justification\nThe idea that when people make sacrifices to pursue a goal, the effort is often rationalized by elevating the attractiveness of the goal\n\"We come to love what we suffer to achieve.\"\nIs your sacrifice really worth it? Are you sure?\nRisk Compensation\nPeople adjust their behavior in response to perceived levels of risk, becoming more careful where they sense greater risk and less careful if they feel more protected\nCounterintuitively, this can lead to greater risk-seeking behaviour in \"safe\" environments\nArmchair Fallacy\nThe tendency to be confident in critising other people's work, even if we are less informed in the area of the work than they are\nRemember: It's a hundred times easeier to criticize than create\nAppeal to Novelty Fallacy\nClaiming that something must be superior simply because it's \"new\"‚Äîcan apply to a product or idea\n\"Keeping up with the latest trends is always an excellent idea.\"\nGood things tend to stick around for a reason (The Lindy Effect)\nDisposition Effect\nA tendency to prematurely sell assets that have made gains, while holding on to assets that are losing money\nWe are driven to sell winning investments to ensure a profit, but are averse to selling losing investments in hopes of turning them into gains\nSystem Justification\nA social psychological tendency to defend and bolster the status quo, that is, to see it as good, fair, legitimate, and desirable\nThis can come at the expense of individual and self-interest if there are better alternatives not being explored\nReverse Psychology\nWhen your true intent is different from what you ask a person to do, you are using reverse psychology\nThe result is that the other person behaves the way you would genuinely like them to, even though you didn‚Äôt ask them directly\nMaslow's Hammer\nWhen we acquire a new skill, we tend to see opportunities to use it everywhere\n\"If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\"\nThis can make us inefficient by overusing a specific tool instead of the tool best suited to the job at hand\nChesterton's Fence\nReforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing state of affairs is understood\nMaking great decisions requires understanding previous decisions. If we don‚Äôt understand how we got ‚Äúhere,‚Äù we run the risk of making things much worse\nHippo Problem\nThe highest individually paid person‚Äôs opinion\nMany companies have a HIPPO in the room. This leads to sub-optimal decision making. It's related to the idea of the \"loudest voice\"\nWe should always preference objective decision-making over subjective opinions\nAmbiguity Bias\nWe tend to avoid options that we consider to be ambiguous or to be missing information\nWe dislike uncertainty and are therefore more inclined to select an option for which the probability of achieving a certain favorable outcome is known\nDelmore Effect\nThe simpler the problem, the more time we spend solving it. The more complex the problem, the more we avoid it\nRemember: Understanding complexity requires time on the problem. And the more the time spent on the problem, the better the chances of solving it\nSapir-Whorf-Korzybski Hypothesis\nAlso known as the Linguistic Relativity Hypothesis (LRH), refers to the idea that the language you speak will affect the way that you understand the world around you\nDifferent language patterns yield different patterns of thought\nImplicit Stereotyping\nStereotyping‚Äîattributing certain characteristics to a particular member of a group‚Äîthat occurs sub-consciously\nEven if you say men and women are equal at math, it's possible that you associate math more strongly with men without being actively aware of it\nPrejudice\nRefers to attitudes and feelings‚Äîwhether positive or negative and whether conscious or non-conscious‚Äîthat people have about members of other groups\nGroups can include: Political affiliation, sex, gender, gender identity, beliefs, values, social class, or age\nSerial Recall Effect\nThe tendency of a person to recall the first and last items in a series best, and the middle items worst\nAwareness of this can assist us when choosing how to present information or in how we remember past events and their relative importance\nMemory Inhibition\nThe ability‚Äîwith or without intention‚Äînot to remember irrelevant information allowing us to remember critical items only\nIn order to remember something, it's essential not only to activate the relevant information, but also to inhibit irrelevant information\nPrimacy Effect\nOur tendency to better remember information at the beginning of a series\nItems at the beginning of a series are stored in our long-term memory more easily because it takes less processing power for our brains to remember single item\nLevels of Processing Effect\nThe idea that the way information is encoded affects how well it is remembered\nMere repetition helps, but information encoded on a deeper level, through meaningful association, is easier to remember long-term\nReward and Punishment\nWe base what is rewarding or punishing on our associations to past experiences and their consequences or with values or preferences we are born with\nAn action that is reinforced becomes stronger over time. An action that is punished dissolves over time\nSelf-Interest and Incentives Bias\nPeople do what they perceive is in their best interest and are biased by incentives\nDon't automatically trust people who have something at stake from your decision. Understand people's motivation\nAsk: What are the interests? Who benefits?\nSelf Deception and Denial\nWe deny and distort reality to feel more comfortable, especially when it threatens our self-interest\nDenial must be weighed against financial and emotional costs\nWhen the cost of denial is worse than the benefit of facing reality, we must face reality\nVividness Illusion\nThe more dramatic, salient, personal, entertaining, or emotional some information, event or experience is, the more influenced we are\nA vivid description is more believable than true evidence\nAccurate information is better than dramatic information\nAbstract Blindness\nThe tendency to react to stimuli that we personally encounter or that grabs our attention, but to disregard alternatives\nWe react more strongly to the concrete and specific than to the abstract\nSensemaking\nOur tendency to rationalise decisions and justify choices by telling ourselves comforting stories\nWe use stories to understand, remember and make sense of events\nWe don‚Äôt like uncertainty. We have a need to understand and make sense of events. We refuse to accept the unknown\nWe therefore seek explanations for why things happen.By finding patterns and causal relationships we get comfort and learn for the future\nHowever, we should always consider how other possible outcomes might have happened. Don‚Äôt underestimate chance\nBelieve First and Doubt Later\nOur natural tendency to find it easy to believe, but difficult to doubt\nWe aren't natural skeptics and we must believe first to understand, so we have a tendency to be lenient with others reasons\nWith unfamiliar people, we must be cautious\nThat‚Äôs it, thanks for reading!If you got value out of this, I‚Äôd appreciate you sharing it or my Twitter profileon Twitter so others can get wiser too :)\n‚Äç\n","wordCount":"2902","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-07-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-07-02T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://alexbrogan.com/newsletters/2025-07-02-a-special-gift-and-60-more-mental-models/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Alex Brogan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://alexbrogan.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://alexbrogan.com/ accesskey=h title="Alex Brogan (Alt + H)">Alex Brogan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

When possible, we should check our pattern matching against objective information</p><p><strong>Mental Simulation</strong></p><p>Our mind‚Äôs ability to imagine taking a specific action and simulating the probable result before acting</p><p>How often do you use your imagination to simulate the results of specific actions or goals? This improves our ability to solve the problems in front of us</p><p><strong>Interpretation and Reinterpretation</strong></p><p>When there‚Äôs not enough information to develop an accurate pattern, we rely on prior information to make interpretations</p><p>Reinterpration involves changing your beliefs about a past event‚Äîit's a powerful tool to overcome negative experiences</p><p><strong>Motivation</strong></p><p>An emotional state that links the parts of your brain that feel with the parts responsible for action</p><p>Motivation results from no conflict or confusion over the best course of action‚Äîit can involve moving towards something desirable or away from something undesirable</p><p><strong>Inhibition</strong></p><p>The ability to temporarily override our natural inclinations (habits)</p><p>Willpower is the fuel of Inhibition. Whenever we inhibit our natural responses to our environment, willpower is at work</p><p>However, we only have limited willpower, so must use inhibition sparingly</p><p><strong>Status Signals</strong></p><p>Tangible indicators of an intangible quality that increases a person's status or group affiliation. Rare or expensive items, awards, honors, etc.</p><p>Whenever possible, we should avoid playing "status" games, and do things that are intrinsically motivating to us</p><p><strong>Status Malfunction</strong></p><p>The more attractive an option looks in terms of "status", the more likely it is to have drawbacks, and the more likely you are to ignore those drawbacks and pursue that option anyway</p><p>Be willing to ignore shiny distractions for meaningful work</p><p><strong>Threat Lockdown (Fight-or-flight response)</strong></p><p>A heightened protective mode your mind and body enter when they sense an impending external threat</p><p>To overcome this mode, we must convince our mind that the threat no longer exists or never truly existed to the extent we believed</p><p><strong>Cognitive Scope Limitation</strong></p><p>Our minds tendency to simplify reality in the face of overwhelming information. Can lead to suboptimal decisions as we fail to consider the full "scope" of the issue</p><p>‚ÄúOne death is a tragedy. A million deaths is a statistic.‚Äù‚ÄîKurt Tucholsky</p><p><strong>Association</strong></p><p>The tendency of the human mind to store information contextually. We constantly look for patterns, even when they don't exist, this can lead to associations forming between things that aren't logically connected</p><p><strong>Absence Blindness</strong></p><p>When you don‚Äôt notice or pay attention to things that are going well</p><p>Example: We tend to notice referee's only when they perform poorly</p><p>To judge fairly, we should be conscious of this bias and ensure we pay as much attention to good work as bad work</p><p><strong>Novelty</strong></p><p>Novelty is the presence of new sensory data. Human attention needs novelty to sustain itself</p><p>Novelty is paramount if you want to attract and maintain attention over a long period of time</p><p>Continue offering something new, and people will keep paying attention</p><p><strong>False Precision (Roughly Right > Precisely Wrong)</strong></p><p>Occurs when numerical data is presented in a manner that implies better precision than is justified</p><p>It's the belief that greater precision implies greater accuracy</p><p>Are you getting more useful data or just more data in general?</p><p><strong>Weber-Fechner Law</strong></p><p>We tend to only perceive a change in a stimulus from any sense (sight, hearing, taste, touch, smell) if that change is at least equal to the pre-existing stimulus</p><p>Can you notice which half (left or right) increased in number of dots?</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type=image data-rt-align=center><div><img src=https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640fb02524545cc834622093_FNGkw9NXEAITIdy.jpeg width=auto height=auto loading=auto></div></figure><p><strong>Congruence Bias</strong></p><p>The tendency to over-rely on testing an initial hypothesis while neglecting to test alternative hypotheses</p><p>That is, people rarely try experiments that could disprove their initial belief, but rather try to repeat their initial results (form of confirmation bias)</p><p><strong>Continued Influence Effect</strong></p><p>Exposure to misinformation continues to impact belief and reasoning, even if that misinformation has been corrected</p><p>This effect is highly relevant in today's world of persistent fake news and misinformation‚Äîdon't believe everything you see and hear</p><p><strong>Bucket Error</strong></p><p>When multiple different concepts or variables are incorrectly lumped together in one's mind as a single concept/variable</p><p>You believe you can only become a writer if you don't make spelling mistakes; however, the two concepts are in fact separate variables</p><p><strong>Law of Narrative Gravity</strong></p><p>The public and press are drawn to narratives, and the more widely accepted a narrative, the more it attracts and shapes the perception of facts</p><p>Explains why it's critical to shape your own narrative as a company or individual before others do</p><p><strong>Anecdotal Fallacy</strong></p><p>The tendency to use a personal experience or an isolated example instead of a sound argument or compelling evidence</p><p>Quantitative scientific measures are almost always more accurate than personal perceptions and experiences</p><p><strong>Masked Man Fallacy</strong></p><p>A fallacy of inferring that since one knows (or does not know) something by one description, one must know (or not know) it by another</p><p>"I know who my father is. I do not know who the masked man is. Therefore, my father is not the masked man.‚Äù</p><p><strong>Recency Illusion</strong></p><p>The belief that things you have noticed only recently are in fact recent‚Äîor have only just come into existence</p><p>"Whoa, that's new to me. It must be new to the world!"</p><p>When we think something is new, we treat it as new, and therefore miss important context</p><p><strong>Anthropomorphism</strong></p><p>The attribution of human traits, emotions, or intentions to non-human things‚Äîit helps us make sense of the behaviours and events we encounter</p><p>However, perceiving the presence of human qualities in other entities can be misleading when such qualities are absent</p><p><strong>Essentialism</strong></p><p>The belief that groups of people, such as men and women, have different basic characteristics that cannot be changed and that are necessary to their identity</p><p>Beware of this belief as it can lead to rigid thinking and perception of our surrounding environment</p><p><strong>Cheerleader Effect</strong></p><p>The cognitive bias which causes people to think individuals are more attractive when they are in a group</p><p>Arises from a tendency of the mind to not process every individual detail they perceive, but rather summarise or categorise information as a group</p><p><strong>Mental Accounting</strong></p><p>A tendency to place different values on the same amount of money, based on subjective criteria, often with detrimental results</p><p>Helps explain why people are willing to spend more when they pay with a credit card than cash</p><p><strong>Appeal To Probability Fallacy</strong></p><p>Asserting that since something is probably the case, it is certainly the case</p><p>‚ÄúIf I keep doing this long enough, I will probably succeed; therefore, I will succeed.‚Äù</p><p><strong>Magic Number (7+-2)</strong></p><p>The average person can only keep 7 ¬± 2 items in their short-term working memory</p><p>Humans can process finite information. Information overload will lead to distraction that negatively affects performance</p><p>When conveying information, limit it to the essentials</p><p><strong>Swimmer's Body Illusion</strong></p><p>Confusing traits with results</p><p>We think we can get the body of a professional swimmer by swimming a lot.</p><p>In truth, the swimmer is able to reach a professional level due to already having the ‚Äòright‚Äô body</p><p>We should identify and play to our strengths</p><p><strong>Streetlight Effect</strong></p><p>People tend to get their information from where it‚Äôs easiest to look</p><p>E.g. We use the first page of Google search results for the majority of research regrdless of how factual the results are. Cumulatively, this can skew knowlege in an entire field</p><p><strong>Planning Fallacy</strong></p><p>A tendency to underestimate the time it will take to complete a future task, despite knowledge that previous tasks have taken longer than planned</p><p>Occurs due to an optimisim bias</p><p><strong>Self-Consistency Bias</strong></p><p>The commonly held idea that we are more consistent in our attitudes, opinions, and beliefs than we actually are</p><p>Example: being unable to see the changes in your thoughts/opinions because you're sure you've always thought the same way</p><p><strong>The Diderot Effect</strong></p><p>The tendency for obtaining a new possession to create a spiral of consumption that leads you to acquire more new things</p><p>We end up buying things that our previous selves never needed to feel happy or fulfilled</p><p>Seek to simplify or eliminate; not consume more</p><p><strong>Premack Principle</strong></p><p>The tendency for a more desirable or higher probability behaviour to enforce a less desirable or lower probability behaviour</p><p>You are a child. You want to play a video game. You're only allowed to play if you eat your vegetables. Result? You eat your vegetables</p><p><strong>Lake Wobegone Effect</strong></p><p>The tendency for most people to believe that they are above average in achievement's or capabilities</p><p>Research has repeatedly shown support for this tendency, but, mathematically speaking, it can't be true</p><p>Assess yourself honestly. Humility breeds growth</p><p><strong>Effort Justification</strong></p><p>The idea that when people make sacrifices to pursue a goal, the effort is often rationalized by elevating the attractiveness of the goal</p><p>"We come to love what we suffer to achieve."</p><p>Is your sacrifice really worth it? Are you sure?</p><p><strong>Risk Compensation</strong></p><p>People adjust their behavior in response to perceived levels of risk, becoming more careful where they sense greater risk and less careful if they feel more protected</p><p>Counterintuitively, this can lead to greater risk-seeking behaviour in "safe" environments</p><p><strong>Armchair Fallacy</strong></p><p>The tendency to be confident in critising other people's work, even if we are less informed in the area of the work than they are</p><p>Remember: It's a hundred times easeier to criticize than create</p><p><strong>Appeal to Novelty Fallacy</strong></p><p>Claiming that something must be superior simply because it's "new"‚Äîcan apply to a product or idea</p><p>"Keeping up with the latest trends is always an excellent idea."</p><p>Good things tend to stick around for a reason (The Lindy Effect)</p><p><strong>Disposition Effect</strong></p><p>A tendency to prematurely sell assets that have made gains, while holding on to assets that are losing money</p><p>We are driven to sell winning investments to ensure a profit, but are averse to selling losing investments in hopes of turning them into gains</p><p><strong>System Justification</strong></p><p>A social psychological tendency to defend and bolster the status quo, that is, to see it as good, fair, legitimate, and desirable</p><p>This can come at the expense of individual and self-interest if there are better alternatives not being explored</p><p><strong>Reverse Psychology</strong></p><p>When your true intent is different from what you ask a person to do, you are using reverse psychology</p><p>The result is that the other person behaves the way you would genuinely like them to, even though you didn‚Äôt ask them directly</p><p><strong>Maslow's Hammer</strong></p><p>When we acquire a new skill, we tend to see opportunities to use it everywhere</p><p>"If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."</p><p>This can make us inefficient by overusing a specific tool instead of the tool best suited to the job at hand</p><p><strong>Chesterton's Fence</strong></p><p>Reforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing state of affairs is understood</p><p>Making great decisions requires understanding previous decisions. If we don‚Äôt understand how we got ‚Äúhere,‚Äù we run the risk of making things much worse</p><p><strong>Hippo Problem</strong></p><p>The highest individually paid person‚Äôs opinion</p><p>Many companies have a HIPPO in the room. This leads to sub-optimal decision making. It's related to the idea of the "loudest voice"</p><p>We should always preference objective decision-making over subjective opinions</p><p><strong>Ambiguity Bias</strong></p><p>We tend to avoid options that we consider to be ambiguous or to be missing information</p><p>We dislike uncertainty and are therefore more inclined to select an option for which the probability of achieving a certain favorable outcome is known</p><p><strong>Delmore Effect</strong></p><p>The simpler the problem, the more time we spend solving it. The more complex the problem, the more we avoid it</p><p>Remember: Understanding complexity requires time on the problem. And the more the time spent on the problem, the better the chances of solving it</p><p><strong>Sapir-Whorf-Korzybski Hypothesis</strong></p><p>Also known as the Linguistic Relativity Hypothesis (LRH), refers to the idea that the language you speak will affect the way that you understand the world around you</p><p>Different language patterns yield different patterns of thought</p><p><strong>Implicit Stereotyping</strong></p><p>Stereotyping‚Äîattributing certain characteristics to a particular member of a group‚Äîthat occurs sub-consciously</p><p>Even if you say men and women are equal at math, it's possible that you associate math more strongly with men without being actively aware of it</p><p><strong>Prejudice</strong></p><p>Refers to attitudes and feelings‚Äîwhether positive or negative and whether conscious or non-conscious‚Äîthat people have about members of other groups</p><p>Groups can include: Political affiliation, sex, gender, gender identity, beliefs, values, social class, or age</p><p><strong>Serial Recall Effect</strong></p><p>The tendency of a person to recall the first and last items in a series best, and the middle items worst</p><p>Awareness of this can assist us when choosing how to present information or in how we remember past events and their relative importance</p><p><strong>Memory Inhibition</strong></p><p>The ability‚Äîwith or without intention‚Äînot to remember irrelevant information allowing us to remember critical items only</p><p>In order to remember something, it's essential not only to activate the relevant information, but also to inhibit irrelevant information</p><p><strong>Primacy Effect</strong></p><p>Our tendency to better remember information at the beginning of a series</p><p>Items at the beginning of a series are stored in our long-term memory more easily because it takes less processing power for our brains to remember single item</p><p><strong>Levels of Processing Effect</strong></p><p>The idea that the way information is encoded affects how well it is remembered</p><p>Mere repetition helps, but information encoded on a deeper level, through meaningful association, is easier to remember long-term</p><p><strong>Reward and Punishment</strong></p><p>We base what is rewarding or punishing on our associations to past experiences and their consequences or with values or preferences we are born with</p><p>An action that is reinforced becomes stronger over time. An action that is punished dissolves over time</p><p><strong>Self-Interest and Incentives Bias</strong></p><p>People do what they perceive is in their best interest and are biased by incentives</p><p>Don't automatically trust people who have something at stake from your decision. Understand people's motivation</p><p>Ask: What are the interests? Who benefits?</p><p><strong>Self Deception and Denial</strong></p><p>We deny and distort reality to feel more comfortable, especially when it threatens our self-interest</p><p>Denial must be weighed against financial and emotional costs</p><p>When the cost of denial is worse than the benefit of facing reality, we must face reality</p><p><strong>Vividness Illusion</strong></p><p>The more dramatic, salient, personal, entertaining, or emotional some information, event or experience is, the more influenced we are</p><p>A vivid description is more believable than true evidence</p><p>Accurate information is better than dramatic information</p><p><strong>Abstract Blindness</strong></p><p>The tendency to react to stimuli that we personally encounter or that grabs our attention, but to disregard alternatives</p><p>We react more strongly to the concrete and specific than to the abstract</p><p><strong>Sensemaking</strong></p><p>Our tendency to rationalise decisions and justify choices by telling ourselves comforting stories</p><p>We use stories to understand, remember and make sense of events</p><p>We don‚Äôt like uncertainty. We have a need to understand and make sense of events. We refuse to accept the unknown</p><p>We therefore seek explanations for why things happen.By finding patterns and causal relationships we get comfort and learn for the future</p><p>However, we should always consider how other possible outcomes might have happened. Don‚Äôt underestimate chance</p><p><strong>Believe First and Doubt Later</strong></p><p>Our natural tendency to find it easy to believe, but difficult to doubt</p><p>We aren't natural skeptics and we must believe first to understand, so we have a tendency to be lenient with others reasons</p><p>With unfamiliar people, we must be cautious</p><h1>That‚Äôs it, thanks for reading!</h1><p>If you got value out of this, I‚Äôd appreciate you <a href=https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nZXRyZXZ1ZS5jby9wcm9maWxlL2FsZXhicm9nYW4_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPU1lbnRhbCUyME1vZGVscyUyQyUyMENvbmNlcHRzJTJDJTIwYW5kJTIwRnJhbWV3b3JrcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9UmV2dWUlMjBuZXdzbGV0dGVyIiwicG9zdF9pZCI6IjRiMTJkYzM1LTQ1MjMtNGIwMS1hZTNiLTI5YWRjYTZjMjc2MSIsInB1YmxpY2F0aW9uX2lkIjoiMTM3ZDVlODMtOTUwMy00ZGI3LWE4YzQtZjM0MTVjMjA1NWFlIiwidmlzaXRfdG9rZW4iOiI3Y2I3YjdlNS05MTI1LTQ0MmYtYjhiOC0yN2NkYzE1MmFkYmIiLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzg3MDU2NjIuMzc2LCJpc3MiOiJvcmNoaWQifQ.FiU1ITH48EkqVWa-nxIN2S9-Dt5SgijK6BEUP6-cSbU target=_blank>sharing it</a> or my <a href=https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3R3aXR0ZXIuY29tL19hbGV4YnJvZ2FuP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1NZW50YWwlMjBNb2RlbHMlMkMlMjBDb25jZXB0cyUyQyUyMGFuZCUyMEZyYW1ld29ya3MmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPVJldnVlJTIwbmV3c2xldHRlciIsInBvc3RfaWQiOiI0YjEyZGMzNS00NTIzLTRiMDEtYWUzYi0yOWFkY2E2YzI3NjEiLCJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbl9pZCI6IjEzN2Q1ZTgzLTk1MDMtNGRiNy1hOGM0LWYzNDE1YzIwNTVhZSIsInZpc2l0X3Rva2VuIjoiN2NiN2I3ZTUtOTEyNS00NDJmLWI4YjgtMjdjZGMxNTJhZGJiIiwiaWF0IjoxNjc4NzA1NjYyLjM3NiwiaXNzIjoib3JjaGlkIn0.Eo4xxbQna7ZY_20vsVeajgArefJPTthpfVk7pgEuQ7o target=_blank>Twitter profile</a>on Twitter so others can get wiser too :)</p><p>‚Äç</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://alexbrogan.com/>Alex Brogan</a></span> ¬∑
