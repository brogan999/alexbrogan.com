E.g., Learn programming by building a website\nKnowledge: Write an essay or blog post. E.g., Sleep tips post\nTechnique 2: Immersive Learning\nInvolves surrounding yourself directly in the environment where the skill will be used.\nExample: Moving to a country to learn the native language.\nAn extreme example would be not allowing yourself to speak your first-language while there.\nTechnique 3: The Overkill Approach\nInvolves putting yourself in a high-demand environment, so you're unlikely to miss important feedback lessons.\nExample: Standing onstage as early as possible to deliver a public speech when learning public speaking.\nMore feedback = more learning.\nTechnique 4: Retrieval\nThe hard thing to do when learning is actively trying to recall without re-reading or viewing.\nFew will make the effort, so few get the rewards.\n‚ÄúIt pays better to wait and recollect by an effort from within, than to look at the book again\" - William James\nTechnique 5: The Question-Book Method\nRephrase notes as questions to be answered later‚Äîthis engages the retrieval muscle.\nWhen reading a book, restate the big idea of a chapter or section as a question.\nThis requires deeper thinking and not just adding a \"?\" to notes you copied verbatim.\nTechnique 6: The Feynman Technique\nThis technique aims to strip away complexity and jargon to help develop a deep understanding of a given topic.\n@SahilBloom explains it in great detail here.\nTechnique 7: Spaced Repetition\nSpreading learning sessions over more intervals over longer periods of time.\nIf you have 10 hours to learn something, it makes more sense to spend 10 days studying one hour each than to spend 10 hours studying in one burst.\nRepeat to remember.\n6 Techniques To Remember MoreFirst, some general principles that underlie the techniques and aid memory:\nWe don't remember all types of information equally (visual and spatial are best)Attach new memories to old memoriesMake information vivid and excitingEngage as many senses as possibleTechnique 1: Memory Palace\n1) Prepare an organised location (E.g. your house layout)\n2) Create markers in this location in an easy to follow order\n3) Make a clear image of the information you would like to remember\n4) Place each item you are trying to remember on the marked locations\nTechnique 2: The Peg Method\nThe pegs act much the same way as clothes pegs.\nThey keep information hanging around in your mind.\n1) Choose a list of ordered items that you can easily remember (e.g., numbers or months)\n2) When learning new information, attach it to each item in the list\nTechnique 3: The Major System\nThe system works by converting numbers into consonants, then into words by adding vowels.\nSince remembering words is easier than numbers, this system is used to remember numerical sequences, like telephone numbers or year dates.\nh/t for image - @stroebjo\nTechnique 4: Story Method\nThe mind has a natural ability to remember stories.\nCreate a vivid story with the key ideas to be remembered.\nEach idea is represented by key words in the story (which link to the next key word and so on).\nRetell the story a few times to engrave it in memory.\nTechnique 5: Person-Action-Object (PAO)\n2-digit numbers from 00 to 99 are represented by an image of a person performing an action on an object.\nThe number 34 might be Lebron James (person) dunking (action) into a hoop (object).\nThen combine images to remember long strings of numbers.\nTechnique 6: SEE Principle\nTurn images (graphs, drawings, etc.) into exciting things in your mind.\nSense: When you utilise more senses, you will remember more.\nExaggerate: Make your images larger or smaller than life. Make your images illogical.\nEnergize: Give images action.\nThe Magical Number 7 ¬± 2The average person can only hold 5-9 chunks of information (7 ¬± 2) in short-term working memory at any one time.\nA chunk could refer to digits, words, chess positions, or people's faces.\nThis will be less if distractions occur.\nLesson: Take notes.\nChauffeur KnowledgeTwo types of knowledge: Chaffeur and Real.\nChaffeur knowledge: People who know, but don't understand‚Äîthey only give the appearance of knowing.\nReal knowledge: People who have done their homework and paid their dues. They understand the meat of a subject.\nCognitive Switching PenaltyEvery time you switch your attention from one subject to another, you incur this penalty.\nYour brain spends time and energy thrashing, loading and reloading contexts.\nTo avoid unproductive switching, group similar tasks together.\n'Dead' and 'Alive' TimeThere are two types of time: dead and alive.\nDead time is when you're zoning out and letting life happen to you: going through the motions.\nAlive time is when you're in full control, making every second count: learning and growing.\nAlive \u003e Dead.\nWhat are you choosing?\nSpecial Gift: The Modern Polymath Cheat SheetMany of you will know that I like to scour the internet for awesome resources to read. In particular, resources that help cut through the noise and contain signal.\nToday, I have a special curation to share that does just this. It curates top thinkers, podcasts, blogs, and more. If you're a nerd like me, you're bound to enjoy it!\nThe Modern Polymath Cheat Sheet\nThat's it! I hope you enjoyed reading :)If you're enjoying these or think they can be improved, drop me a line!
