If so, what is it?\n2/ How urgent is this need?\n3/ Is this the right time to be learning it?\n4/ Why will I stick with this project when it gets hard?\n5/ Is there a practical use for this learning? Can I use it in my current job?\n6/ Would I learn this if no one ever knew that I learnt it?\nWhen we have a clear \"why\" for learning something, it's easier to remain focused and resilient when it gets difficult.\nChoosing a project you'll stick with long enough is an underappreciated factor in learning.\nIf you switch from project to project, you'll never see the benefit of compounding in any one area.\nFocus is key.\nOnce you've chosen your learning, it's time to deconstruct.\n2/ DeconstructionEvery complex skill or topic is just a combination of different skills or topics, just as every hard problem is a combination of smaller problems.\nTherefore, one of the smartest ways to learn is to first deconstruct into smaller components.\nHow to Deconstruct\nStep 1: Find the approximate scope of the topic of knowledge / skill\nNote down what you need to learn:\n- Concepts\n- Facts/Key definitions\n- Examples or analogies\n- Procedures (if it's a skill)\nStep 2: Produce a checklist or mindmap of the required learning\nFinding the Scope of the Topic\n1. Desktop Search:\n- Mind maps\n- Blog posts\n- University curriculum\n- Reddit or other online forums\n- Table of contents in textbooks\n2. Expert Interview:\n- Find an expert or someone in your network and ask them what you should be learning\n3/ Selection/CompressionHere is where you ask:\n1. Which 20% of the blocks (concepts, facts, procedures) should I focus on for 80% or more of the outcome I want?\n2. What would I learn if I only had 2 weeks to learn?\nFocus on the highest value knowledge first.\n4/ SequencingNow ask:\n1. In what order should I learn the blocks?\n2. What is the best logical progression of learning?\n3. What are the pre-requisites I need to be able to learn and do before the next step?\nWalk before you run.\n5/ ResourcesIn the deconstruct step, you would have found multiple helpful sources that you can use to go deeper.\nNow is the time to select which ones you'll use for your learning.\nNote down what you'll use:\n- Books\n- Videos\n- Podcasts\n- Courses\n- Coaches, etc.\nBonus tip: if you know your learning style, you should preference using resources that align with that learning style.\nLearning styles (VARK Model): Visual, Auditory, Read/Write, Kinaesthetic.\n6/ ScheduleHere's where you make it concrete and ask:\n1. When do I want to complete this learning project?\n2. How many hours will I commit per week?\n3. When am I committing these hours?\nPlace the details in your calendar, set reminders, and make it easy for yourself.\n7/ Stakes/IncentivesHere's where you failure proof your commitment to learning.\nAsk:\n1. How can I set up real consequences to guarantee that I follow my learning project?\n2. How can I failure proof my decision?\nA goal without real consequences is wishful thinking.\nNow it's time to execute.\nI've previously covered 13 powerful learning techniques for the actual learning component.\nYou can dive in here:\nFor more on learning intelligently, these are the best resources I've found:\nThe First 20 Hours: How to Learn Anything...Fast -Josh Kaufman\nThe 4-Hour Chef - Tim Ferriss\nUltralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career - Scott Young\n10 common logical fallaciesAnecdotal (vs. Empirical Evidence)Using a personal experience or an isolated example to try and prove a point instead of empirical or more compelling evidence.\nHumans tend to believe and relate to stories, but don't fall into this trap.\nWhat's true for you isn't always true.\nBegging The QuestionInvolves presenting a circular argument where the conclusion is included in the premise.\nExamples:\n1/ \"Of course smoking causes cancer. The smoke from cigarettes is a carcinogen.\"\n2/ \"Circular reasoning is bad mostly because it's not very good.”\nLikely or Plausible FallacyLikely: Incorrectly assuming that just because something is possible means that it is likely.\nPlausible: Incorrectly assuming that just because something is plausible means that it is true.\nInverse FallacyIncorrectly assuming the probability of A happening given that B has happened to be about the same as the probability of B given A.\nExample: Terrorists tend to have an engineering background; so, engineers have a tendency towards terrorism.\nNope, not the case.\nPost Hoc FallacyBelieving or starting that, \"since event Y followed event X, event Y must have been caused by event X.\"\n\"The rooster crows immediately before sunrise; therefore the rooster causes the sun to rise.\"\nCorrelation does not equal causation.\nThe Texas Sharpshooter FallacyCherry picking data to suit your argument, or finding a pattern to fit a presumption.\nNamed after a Texan firing gunshots at a barn, then painting a shooting target around the tightest cluster of hits and claiming to be a sharpshooter.\nMiddle GroundClaiming that a compromise, or 'middle ground', between two extremes must be the truth of a matter.\nSometimes a thing is simply untrue and a compromise of it is also untrue.\nHalf way between truth and a lie, is still a lie.\nNo True ScotsmanClaiming an appeal to 'purity' to dismiss another argument.\nPerson A: \"No Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.\"\nPerson B: \"But my uncle Angus is a Scotsman and he puts sugar on his porridge.\"\nPerson A: \"But no true Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.”\nThe Common Belief FallacyClaiming that because many people believe or do something that it's a valid reason to believe or do said thing.\nThe popularity of an idea has absolutely no bearing on its validity.\n\"Everyone is doing it, so why aren't you?”\nGenetic FallacyClaiming something is good or bad on the basis of where it came from, or from whom it came.\nIt's the belief that the origin of something determines its worth.\nExample: \"The news article is a conservative publication, so you know whatever it says is true.”\n10 mental models for making sense of the worldGoodhart's Law“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”\nWhen we set a specific goal, people tend to optimize for it regardless of the secondary consequences.\nAn employee is rewarded by the # of cars sold.\nThey try to sell more cars, even at a loss.\nThe Paradox of AbundanceThe average quality of information is decreasing over time.\nBut the highest quality stuff gets better and better.\nAbundance is simultaneously bad for the 'median' consumer but good for the 'conscious, discerning' consumer who filters out noise.\nChronological SnobberyBelieving the stuff of earlier times is inferior to that of the present, simply due to societal progress.\nIt's not enough to talk about “progress;” one must prove that it is so.\nThis requires a rigorous assessment of both the past and the present.\nSturgeon's Law\"Ninety percent of everything is crap.\"\nRepresents the belief that in general, the vast majority of the work that is produced in any given field is of low quality.\nTherefore, we should take our time to find the very best content before we learn or consume.\nNirvana FallacyWe reject something because it compares poorly to an ideal that in reality is unattainable.\nWe assume there is a perfect solution to every problem.\nReality is more complicated and trade-offs are abound.\nTake the option with the most bearable trade-offs.\nNetwork StatesDue to the internet, where you're born no longer determines your community.\nFuture 'nations' may consist of people who are born on opposite sides of the globe who form online subcultures using incentives to crowdsource like-minded people.\nh/t @balajis\nCumulative CultureHumanity's success is due to our culture, not to our individual IQs.\nCulture collects our best ideas for success so they compound across generations.\nThe ideas we adopt from society are often far older than us, and far wiser.\nh/t @SteveStuWill\nVia NegativaWhen we have a problem, our natural instinct is to add a new habit or purchase a solution.\nBut usually, you improve your life by subtracting instead.\nThe foods you avoid are more important than the foods you eat.\nRemoving distractions leads to productivity.\nHock's PrincipleSimple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex and intelligent behavior.\nComplex rules and regulations give rise to simple and stupid behavior.\nObsessive control isn't always the answer to chaos.\nAll Models Are WrongScientific models fall short of the complexities of reality.\nA model is only a simplification or approximation of reality.\nWhile a model can never be \"truth,\" it can be rated from very useful, to useful, to somewhat useful, to essentially useless.\nThat's it!

The smoke from cigarettes is a carcinogen."</p><p>2/ "Circular reasoning is bad mostly because it's not very good.”</p><h2>Likely or Plausible Fallacy</h2><p>Likely: Incorrectly assuming that just because something is possible means that it is likely.</p><p>Plausible: Incorrectly assuming that just because something is plausible means that it is true.</p><h2>Inverse Fallacy</h2><p>Incorrectly assuming the probability of A happening given that B has happened to be about the same as the probability of B given A.</p><p>Example: Terrorists tend to have an engineering background; so, engineers have a tendency towards terrorism.</p><p>Nope, not the case.</p><h2><strong>Post Hoc Fallacy</strong></h2><p>Believing or starting that, "since event Y followed event X, event Y must have been caused by event X."</p><p>"The rooster crows immediately before sunrise; therefore the rooster causes the sun to rise."</p><p>Correlation does not equal causation.</p><h2><strong>The Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy</strong></h2><p>Cherry picking data to suit your argument, or finding a pattern to fit a presumption.</p><p>Named after a Texan firing gunshots at a barn, then painting a shooting target around the tightest cluster of hits and claiming to be a sharpshooter.</p><h2><strong>Middle Ground</strong></h2><p>Claiming that a compromise, or 'middle ground', between two extremes must be the truth of a matter.</p><p>Sometimes a thing is simply untrue and a compromise of it is also untrue.</p><p>Half way between truth and a lie, is still a lie.</p><h2><strong>No True Scotsman</strong></h2><p>Claiming an appeal to 'purity' to dismiss another argument.</p><p>Person A: "No Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge."</p><p>Person B: "But my uncle Angus is a Scotsman and he puts sugar on his porridge."</p><p>Person A: "But no true Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.”</p><h2><strong>The Common Belief Fallacy</strong></h2><p>Claiming that because many people believe or do something that it's a valid reason to believe or do said thing.</p><p>The popularity of an idea has absolutely no bearing on its validity.</p><p>"Everyone is doing it, so why aren't you?”</p><h2><strong>Genetic Fallacy</strong></h2><p>Claiming something is good or bad on the basis of where it came from, or from whom it came.</p><p>It's the belief that the origin of something determines its worth.</p><p>Example: "The news article is a conservative publication, so you know whatever it says is true.”</p><h1>10 mental models for making sense of the world</h1><h2>Goodhart's Law</h2><p>“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”</p><p>When we set a specific goal, people tend to optimize for it regardless of the secondary consequences.</p><p>An employee is rewarded by the #
