discourse.\nThe more attention the media gives to certain issues, the more likely the public is to consider them important.\nDon’t pay blind attention to what’s on the “agenda” and forget what’s not being said.\nThe Ergodic SwitchIn an ergodic scenario, the average outcome of a group is the same as the average outcome of the individual over time.\nWe are taught to think that most systems are ergodic.\nIn reality, most human systems are non-ergodic.\nDon’t blindly believe in averages.\nConvexityConvex payoffs have larger gains than pains—the potential upside is greater than the downside.\nThe majority seek to cap downside by entering conformist professions but in doing so, cap their upside too.\nLesson: Incorporate some calculated risks in your plan.\nThe Map is Not the TerritoryNo model is a perfect representation of reality, but some are still useful.\nThe more complicated the system or territory, the greater the chance of inconsistencies.\nYou don’t truly understand a model or map unless you know its limitations.\nWisdom of the CrowdThe intelligence of a diverse group is superior to that of any of the individuals within the group.\nA useful framework for solving difficult problems.\nWhen possible, seek multiple diverse and alternative perspectives for better solutions.\nThe Paradox of AbundanceThe average quality of information is decreasing over time.\nBut the highest quality stuff gets better and better.\nAbundance is simultaneously bad for the 'median' consumer but good for the 'conscious, discerning' consumer who filters out noise.\nGoogle Scholar EffectHighly cited papers appear in top positions and gain ever more citations.\nNew papers struggle to appear in top positions and therefore get less attention, regardless of their contribution to their fields.\nWhere else is a cumulative advantage at play?\nCurse of KnowledgeOnce we know something, we assume everyone else knows it, too.\nIt's why some experts can't explain their field in simple terms and people don't share knowledge that could benefit others.\nLesson: There are always people to teach and people to learn from.\nPredictive Coding“You experience, in some sense, the world that you expect to experience.”\n—Andy Clark\nOur perception replaces the unknown with the expected to help us organize our experience of the world efficiently.\nAsk, “What might you be over-predicting?”\nLocus of ControlInternal: You believe that outcomes are within your control.\nExternal: You believe that outcomes are outside of your control.\nThe more control you believe you have, the less likely you are to conform to the status quo.\nSeek to believe in control.\n‍\n","wordCount":"453","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-07-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-07-02T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://alexbrogan.com/newsletters/2025-07-02-agenda-setting-theory-the-ergodic-switch-convexity-more/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Alex
