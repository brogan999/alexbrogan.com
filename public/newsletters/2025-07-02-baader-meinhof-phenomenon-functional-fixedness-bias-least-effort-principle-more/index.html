Suddenly, you’re aware of that thing all over the place\nIn reality, there’s no increase in occurrence. It’s just that you’ve started to notice it\nWhy does it happen? Your brain can't take in every detail and chooses to prioritise certain information\nWhen you're exposed to brand-new information, especially if you find it interesting, your brain will tend to prioritise it in the future\nFunctional Fixedness Bias\nA cognitive bias that limits a person to use an object only in the way it is traditionally used\nFunctional fixedness is a mental block against using an object in a new way that is required to solve a problem\nThe \"block\" limits the ability of an individual to use components given to them to complete a task, as they can't move past the original purpose of those components\nE.g., Someone needs a weight, but they only have a hammer, they may not see how the hammer can be used as a weight\nFunctional fixedness isn't always a bad thing. In many cases, it can act as a mental shortcut allowing you to quickly and efficiently determine a practical use for an object\nHowever, in some cases better thinking results from thinking \"outside\" traditional uses\nLeast Effort Principle\nA theory suggesting that animals, humans, and well-designed machines will naturally seek the path of least resistance, and that effort declines as the minimum acceptable result is attained\nFor example, one might consult a generalist co-worker down the hall rather than a specialist in another building, so long as the generalist's answers are within the threshold of acceptability\nThis obvious issue with this is that it doesn't always lead to the best outcome\nA good way to combat this principle is to think through whether the task at hand is a task where the minimum threshold of acceptability is actually acceptable\nIf lives or a business is on the line, it probably pays to make the extra investment required for a good outcome\nHard-Easy Effect\nWe tend to overestimate our ability to do something hard and underestimate our ability to do something easy\nThis leads us to focus on what’s hard even though the thing that’s easy might bring the same, or larger, rewards\nFor example, imagine that you are learning how to drive and have to complete both a written exam and driving test\nArguably the test is more difficult because it's based on knowledge and skill, whereas the exam is mostly based on knowledge\nThe hard-easy effect makes you overconfident in your ability to pass the test and underconfident about how likely you are to pass the written exam\nAs a result, you barely practice driving and focus all your attention on the written exam\nOn test day, you easily pass the written exam, but since you were too confident about your driving skills, you fail the driving test\nThis matters because we face uncertainty on a daily basis, and in order to effectively navigate the world, we need to act in a rational manner\nThe hard-easy effect essentially suggests that we are not being realistic with our abilities and often misplace our confidence\nWe can avoid this effect through external feedback or honest self-assessment\nFocusing Illusion\nNothing is ever as important as what you’re thinking about while you’re thinking about it\nWorrying about a thing makes the thing being worried about seem worse than it is\nAs Marcus Aurelius observed, “We suffer more often in imagination than in reality.”\nReputation Fragility\nReputations are fragile. A person or business gets judged by the worst of their behaviour, and that makes them vulnerable at any point in time\nAs Warren Buffett says: \"It takes 20 years to build a reputation and 5 minutes to ruin it.”\nNoise Bottleneck\nWe think the more information we consume the more signal we’ll consume\nHowever, our ability to comprehend the relevant from the irrelevant becomes compromised in this case\nWe put too much emphasis on irrelevant data and lose sight of what’s really important\nSerpico Effect\nThe tendency to rationalize an action because everyone else is doing it\nThink corporate, government, or police corruption\nNamed after Frank Serpico, who became known for whistleblowing on police corruption in the late 1960s and early 1970s\nCompassion Face\nThe tendency to have more compassion for victims within small groups than larger groups, because the smaller the group the easier it is to identify individual victims\nOne victim can break our hearts while larger groups seem more distanced1\nThree Men Make a Tiger\nThe tendency to accept absurd information as long as it's repeated enough times\nIf one person tells you there’s a tiger in town, you might assume they’re lying. If two people tell you, you begin to wonder\nIf three tell you, you might start running!\nBuridan's Ass\nA type of decision paralysis where two equally good options lead to no decision\nDescribed by the example of an Ass that's stuck between two stacks of hay of equal size and quality, and can't decide which to eat, causing it to starve to death from indecision\nSemmelweis\nRelated to first-conclusion and confirmation bias, the Semmelweis reflex is the tendency to reject new evidence or new information because it contradicts established norms, beliefs, or paradigms\nMcnamara Fallacy\nThe belief that rational decisions are made solely on the basis of quantitative evidence, ignoring all other factors\nDon’t presume that what can’t be measured isn’t really important\nCourtesy Bias\nThe resistance to giving an honest opinion due to a desire not to offend the person or organization in question\nExample: Employees hesitant to give an honest opinion to their superiors, clogging information flow for rational decision making in a company\nLucid Fallacy\nIdentified by @nntaleb, the ludic fallacy is the tendency to falsely associate simulations with real life\nBecause simulations are designed as “narrow worlds of game and dice”, they fail to account for chaos regarding future events in the real world\nAbilene Paradox (Pluralistic Ignorance)\nThe situation where a group decides to make a decision that is counter to the thoughts and feelings of its individual members in the group\nIt happens because the members fail to communicate their individual beliefs\nCollective Narcissism\nThe tendency to exaggerate the positive image and importance of a group that one belongs to\nNormalcy Bias\nThe tendency to believe threats and disasters are not at all probable due to a belief that things will remain as they always have\nBehavioural Inevitability\nThe notion that human behavior, and its inherent biases, will always remain\nAs Voltaire said: History never repeats itself; man always does\nFalse Uniqueness Effect\nAn attributional cognitive error of assuming that one’s qualities, traits, and personal attributes are unique when in reality they are not\nIn essence, it’s the opposite of imposter syndrome\nPositive Illusions\nA form of self-deception that causes individuals to think inflatedly about themselves and their abilities to avoid short-term discomfort or raise self-esteem\nA positive illusion might cause a negative spiral of justifications about worse and worse decisions\nIronic Process Theory\nThe psychological process of attempting to suppress certain thoughts, making those thoughts more likely to resurface in one’s mind\nAn example is how when someone is actively trying not to think of a bear they may actually be more likely to imagine one\nAumann's Agreement Theorem\nThe notion that two rational people in an opposing argument can’t and shouldn’t come to the conclusion of agreeing to disagree if they have common knowledge of each other’s beliefs\nIn other words, it's a cop out or lazy to settle for this\nOstrich Effect\nOstriches bury their heads in the sand to avoid danger. The ostrich effect is the tendency to avoid opposing information to what one desperately wants to be right\nCan mean avoiding believing negative information and allowing a problem to become a bigger problem\nBounded Rationality\nLimits to the capacity of the mind make it impossible to contain and recall all information obtained, and therefore, rationality is also limited\nThis causes us to make choices that are satisfactory rather than optimal (to satisfice, rather than optimize)\nFluency Heuristic\nRelated to the narrative fallacy, fluency heuristic is the tendency to believe more in ideas that are easy to explain rather than those that are hard to comprehend\nPersian Messenger Syndrome\nThe act of blaming the bearer of negative news\nAncient Persians actually killed some messengers whose sole fault was that they brought home truthful bad news, say, of a battle lost\nOkrent's Law\nA law stated by writer Daniel Okrent referring to the phenomenon of the press providing legitimacy to unsupported fringe viewpoints in an effort to appear even-handed\nHe once said: The pursuit of balance can create imbalance because sometimes something is true\nVeirordt's Law\nIn 1868, German physiologist Karl von Vierordt created this law stating that humans perceive time at different magnitudes over different durations\nWe underestimate long periods of time and overestimate short periods of time\nCunningham's Law\nThe best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question. It’s to post the wrong answer\nIf you express anger in your private conversations, your friends will find you tiresome, but when there’s an audience, outrage can boost status\nDelayed Gratification\nThe process an individual undergoes when resisting the temptation of an immediate reward in preference for a later reward\nWe live in a world of instant gratification: those who master the power of delayed gratification are the ones who win long term\nBase Rate Neglect\nA tendency to ignore the a priori probability of something by putting heavier weight on appealing information about an individual’s case\nOnly 3% of applicants make it into this school, but my daughter is brilliant. I’m sure they’re going to accept her!\nNeglect of Probability\nThe tendency to disregard probability in decision making under uncertainty. Small risks are either neglected entirely or hugely overrated\nHindsight bias is a common result of the tendency to neglect probability\nFriendship Paradox\nMost people have fewer friends than their friends have, on average\nPeople with more friends are more likely to be one of your friends (sampling bias)\nIn reality, it's a contradiction because most people believe they have more friends than their friends have\nWoozle Effect\nWhen frequent citation of previous information that lacks evidence misleads individuals into believing it’s evidence\n\"A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth”\nRingelmann Effect\nAs a group size increases, individuals tend to become increasingly less productive\nConsider a tug of war. As more people are involved, their average performance tends to decrease because each participant feels that their own effort is not critical\nGroup Attribution Error\nFalsely assuming that the views and decision outcomes of a collective group reflect the view of each member in that group, even when information is available that indicates that all members do not support the decision\nClosely related to stereotyping\n90-9-1 Rule\nIn a social media network (E.g., Twitter), only 1 percent of users will actively create content; another 9 percent will participate by commenting, rating, or sharing the content; and the last 90 percent will watch, look and read without interacting\nBraess's Paradox\nAn observation by German mathematician Dietrich Braess who noticed that adding a road to a particular congested road traffic network would make traffic worse due to an increase in shortcuts becoming popular and overcrowded\nPollyanna Principle\nIt’s easier to actively remember pleasant memories than bad ones\nThe mind tends to focus on the optimistic at the subconscious level, while it tends to focus on the negative at the conscious level\nEmpathy Gap\nUnderestimating the way behaviour is largely affected by one’s mental state when you're not currently in that mental state\nIf you feel calm, you'll find it difficult to predict how you'll act if someone angers you\nMeat Paradox\nMany of us experience the 'meat paradox', whereby we simultaneously care for animals such as cows, yet also consume them as meat\nApplies to many other moral issues where we stay in the 'dark', to protect the illusion that we are morally consistent and sensible\nEmotional Contagion\nThe automatic adoption of the emotional state of another person through observation; some are more susceptible to cues than others\nHappiness and misery love company\nBe careful who you spend your time around, their energy is infectious\nIntrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation\nIntrinsic arises when you find something personally or intrinsically rewarding, while extrinsic comes from incentives or punishment\nIntrinsic is a better source of long-term motivation, but extrinsic can be used effectively in the short-term\nBig Five Personality Traits\nThe most academically accepted model of basic personality traits, sometimes referred to as the OCEAN model: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism\nThese factors exist on a continuum and encompass several subfactors\nDISC Model\nA model of human behaviour commonly used in business settings describing four distinct temperaments that can be found in individuals\nD: Dominance\nI: Influence\nS: Steadiness\nC: Compliance\nInstrumental Conditioning\nOccurs when you choose to continue, or discontinue, a behaviour based on the positive or negative reinforcement you've received for that behaviour previously\nAlso known as \"trial-and-error\" learning\nBlind spot\nAn area of thought or perception that goes unchecked and can have negative consequences\nSomething you systematically overlook either intentionally, but more likely, subconsciously. It leads to a distortion of reality and inferior thinking\nChoice-supportive bias\nThe tendency to remember our choices as better than they actually were\nWe choose option A over B, we are likely to dismiss faults of A, while amplifying faults of B. Conversely, we'll amplify the advantages of A and de-emphasize those of option B\nDenomination Effect\nWe are less likely to spend money in the form of large bills relative to the equivalent amount in smaller bills\nA $50 note has the same value as 10 $5 notes, but we will invariably spend the lower value notes before we even think of touching the $50\nDecoy Effect\nDescribes how, when we are choosing between two alternatives, the addition of a third, less attractive option (decoy) can influence our perception of the original two choices\nDistinction Bias\nDescribes how, in decision-making, we tend to overvalue the differences between two options when we examine them together\nConversely, we consider these differences to be less important when we evaluate the options separately\nDuration Neglect\nThe psychological principle that the length of an experience has little effect on the memory of that event\nThe overall rating is determined by the peak intensity of the experience and the end of the experience (Peak-end rule)\nEndowment effect\nWhen you place a higher value on an object that you already own compared to the same object if you didn't own it\nStart from zero, what would the product be worth to you if you didn't own it? Don't form emotional attachments without good reason\nExaggerated expectation\nThe tendency to expect or predict more extreme outcomes than those outcomes that actually happen\nExample: worrying about an upcoming public speech and picturing the worst-case scenario. In reality, nothing happens and it's fine.\nFocalism\nThe tendency to place too much focus or emphasis on a single factor or piece of information when making judgments or predictions\n“Nothing in life is quite as important as you think it is while you are thinking about it.”\nIllusion of Validity\nThe tendency to be overconfident in the accuracy of our judgements, specifically in our interpretations and predictions regarding a given data set\nTo cope with the world, we construct narratives that provide a coherent explanation for random occurrences\nIllusory correlation\nWhen we see an association between two variables (events, actions, ideas, etc.) when they aren’t actually associated\nWe tend to overestimate the importance of events we can easily recall and then make associations between them\nInformation Bias\nA type of bias or error that can occur when researchers are unable to collect accurate data\nA flaw in measuring exposure, covariate, or outcome variables that results in different quality (accuracy) of information between comparison groups\nImpact bias\nThe tendency for people to overestimate the length or the intensity of future emotional states\nYou think it will take longer to recover emotionally from disaster than it actually will\nIrrational escalation\nThe phenomenon where people increase their investment in a decision despite new evidence suggesting that the decision was probably wrong\nMay include money (\"throwing good money after bad\"), time, or — in the case of military strategy — human lives\nLess-is-better effect\nPeople sometimes prefer the worse of two options, but only when the options are presented separately\nWhen people consider both their choices together, their preferences reverse, so that the less-is-better effect disappears\nMoney illusion\nThe tendency to view wealth and income in nominal dollar terms, rather than recognize their real value, adjusted for inflation\nInflation matters\nMoral Credential effect\nThe subconscious tendency whereby increased confidence and security in one's self-image tends to make you worry less about the consequences of subsequent immoral behavior and, therefore, more likely to make immoral choices and act immorally\nOutcome bias\nAn error made in evaluating the quality of a decision when the outcome of that decision is already known\nInvolves judging a past decision by its ultimate outcome rather than the quality of the decision at the time it was made, given what was known at that time\nOverconfidence effect\nWhere subjective confidence in your own judgments is reliably greater than the objective accuracy of those judgments, especially when confidence is relatively high\nKnown as the most \"pervasive and potentially catastrophic\" of all the cognitive biases\nPro-innovation bias\nBelieving an innovation should be adopted by all of society without the need for close examination of its limitations or weaknesses\nExample: The atomic bomb. Many legislators promoted widespread adoption without close examination of pitfalls and dangers\nPseudocertainty effect\nThe tendency to perceive an outcome as certain when it's actually uncertain in multi-stage decision making\nThe evaluation of the certainty of the outcome in a previous stage of decisions is disregarded when selecting an option in subsequent stages\nReactive devaluation\nThe tendency to disparage proposals made by another party, especially if this party is viewed as negative or antagonistic\nWe should always assess proposals on their merits, not on their proposer's merits. Further, we should optimise for long-term outcomes\nRestraint bias\nOur tendency to overestimate the level of control we have over our impulsive behaviours\nThese urges typically come from “primal impulses” such as hunger, drug cravings, fatigue, or sexual arousal\nHack: Out of sight, out of mind—take temptation out of view\nRhyme as a reason effect\nWe are more likely to believe statements that contain a rhyme, compared to statements that don't\n\"Woes unite foes\"\n\"Woes unite enemies\"\n\"Misfortune unites enemies\"\nWhich seems more believable? Be wary of this in advertising or persuasion\nSelective perception\nThe tendency not to notice and more quickly forget stimuli that cause emotional discomfort and contradict our prior beliefs\nCan cause issues when you allow small problems to become bigger problems through a lack of appropriate attention\nSocial comparison bias\nThe tendency to have feelings of dislike and competitiveness with someone seen as physically or mentally better than oneself\nRemember: We are only competing against our past selves—be better than you were yesterday\nSubadditivity effect\nThe tendency to judge the probability of the whole to be less than the probabilities of the parts\nWhen assigning probabilities to questions or problems, decomposition into small parts to ensure probabilities and risks are understood at a more granular level\nSubjective Validation\nBelieving or accepting an idea or statement if it presents to you in a personal and positive way\nExample: you enjoy eating bacon and come across an article that talks about bacon as healthy, you'll believe it more because this \"validates\" eating more bacon\nTime-saving bias\nMisestimating the time that could be saved (or lost) when increasing (or decreasing) speed\nNot limited to driving, can also apply in areas like healthcare, where we misestimate the effect of adding or subtracting physicians on waiting times\nRoad well-travelled effect\nWhere travellers (or commuters) estimate the time taken to traverse routes differently depending on their familiarity with the route\nFrequently travelled routes are assessed as taking a shorter time than unfamiliar routes\nUnit Bias\nThe tendency to think of a unit (rather than a fraction or %) of something as the appropriate or optimal amount\nIf you’ve ever felt you should finish the chapter of the book you were reading before placing it on the nightstand, then you’ve felt the nudge of unit bias\nZero-sum heuristic\nJudging a situation to be zero-sum (i.e., person A's gain is person B's loss) when it is actually non-zero-sum (both parties can gain together)\n\"There’s a false notion that poor countries are poor because rich countries are rich.\"\n- Michael Miller\nEgocentric bias\nThe tendency to rely too heavily on your own point of view when examining events or trying to see things from other people’s perspective\nExample: You overestimate the amount of work that you contributed to a group project\nExtrinsic incentive bias\nThe tendency to attribute other people's motives to extrinsic incentives, such as job security or high wages, rather than intrinsic ones, such as learning new things or building a new skill\nIllusion of transparency\nThe tendency for people to overestimate the degree to which their personal mental state is known by others\nAlso applies to overestimating how well we understand others personal mental states\nIllusion of external agency\nThe false belief that good and positive things happen because of external influences rather than personal effort.\nFor example, you get good grades in school and attribute that to external variables (\"The teacher likes me\" or \"I got lucky\")\nIllusory superiority\nThe tendency to overestimate your positive qualities and abilities and to underestimate negative qualities, relative to others\nApplies to intelligence, performance on tasks, and the possession of desirable characteristics or personality traits\nProjection bias\nA self-forecasting error, where we overestimate how much our future selves will share the same beliefs, values and behaviours as our current selves, causing us to make short-sighted decisions\nTrait ascription bias\nThe tendency for people to view themselves as relatively variable in terms of personality, behavior and mood while viewing others as much more predictable in their personal traits across different situations\nWorse-than-average effect\nThe tendency to underestimate one's achievements and capabilities in relation to others\nRelated to imposter syndrome and is the opposite of the usually pervasive better-than-average effect (Dunning-Kruger effect)\nUltimate Attribution error\nWe tend to attribute good acts by friends to their character, and bad acts by friends to situational factors\nFor enemies (or people we dislike), it’s reversed: good acts are attributed to situational factors and bad acts to character\nChange bias\nRemembering the past as more difficult than it actually was\nAfter exerting effort and causing a change in some area, this bias makes you believe your journey and work were more difficult than they actually were\n\"When I was a boy... things weren't so easy”\nChildhood amnesia\nThe inability of adults to retrieve memories before the age of two to four years, as well as the period before the age of ten, of which some older adults retain fewer memories than might otherwise be expected given the passage of time\nContext effect\nAn event is more favourably perceived and remembered when the surrounding environment is comfortable and appealing\nCross-race effect\nA facial recognition phenomenon in which individuals show superior performance in identifying faces of their own race when compared with memory for faces of another, less familiar race\nFading affect bias\nThe tendency for memories associated with negative emotions to be forgotten more quickly than those associated with positive emotions\nThis helps us forget bad experiences more readily\nGeneration effect (Self-generation effect)\nThe tendency for information to be better remembered when it is self-generated as opposed to passively consumed\nExplains why active recall is one of the most effective learning and retention techniques\nHumor effect\nThe tendency for humorous items to be remembered more easily than non-humorous ones\nPotentially explained by the increased cognitive processing time to understand the humor, or the emotional arousal caused by the humor\nLag effect\nWe retain information better when there are longer breaks between repeated presentations of that information\nThe lag effect suggests that the longer the time between repetitions of information, the more likely we are to commit that information to memory\nLevelling and sharpening\nLevelling and sharpening are processes we use during memory recollection\nLevelling refers to the tendency to omit minor details and distinctions, whereas sharpening occurs when certain aspects of a memory are exaggerated or made more profound\nList-length effect\nAs the length of a list gets longer, a greater number of items are actually remembered\nWhen you go shopping and forget your list, you remember only a few items—this happens whether it's a short or a long list. If it's long, you'll tend to remember more\nMisinformation effect\nThe tendency for post-event information to interfere with the memory of the original event\nFor example, if a question contains misleading information, it can distort the memory of an event.

Suddenly, you’re aware of that thing all over the place</p><p>In reality, there’s no increase in occurrence. It’s just that you’ve started to notice it</p><p>Why does it happen? Your brain can't take in every detail and chooses to prioritise certain information</p><p>When you're exposed to brand-new information, especially if you find it interesting, your brain will tend to prioritise it in the future</p><p><strong>Functional Fixedness Bias</strong></p><p>A cognitive bias that limits a person to use an object only in the way it is traditionally used</p><p>Functional fixedness is a mental block against using an object in a new way that is required to solve a problem</p><p>The "block" limits the ability of an individual to use components given to them to complete a task, as they can't move past the original purpose of those components</p><p>E.g., Someone needs a weight, but they only have a hammer, they may not see how the hammer can be used as a weight</p><p>Functional fixedness isn't always a bad thing. In many cases, it can act as a mental shortcut allowing you to quickly and efficiently determine a practical use for an object</p><p>However, in some cases better thinking results from thinking "outside" traditional uses</p><p><strong>Least Effort Principle</strong></p><p>A theory suggesting that animals, humans, and well-designed machines will naturally seek the path of least resistance, and that effort declines as the minimum acceptable result is attained</p><p>For example, one might consult a generalist co-worker down the hall rather than a specialist in another building, so long as the generalist's answers are within the threshold of acceptability</p><p>This obvious issue with this is that it doesn't always lead to the best outcome</p><p>A good way to combat this principle is to think through whether the task at hand is a task where the minimum threshold of acceptability is actually acceptable</p><p>If lives or a business is on the line, it probably pays to make the extra investment required for a good outcome</p><p><strong>Hard-Easy Effect</strong></p><p>We tend to overestimate our ability to do something hard and underestimate our ability to do something easy</p><p>This leads us to focus on what’s hard even though the thing that’s easy might bring the same, or larger, rewards</p><p>For example, imagine that you are learning how to drive and have to complete both a written exam and driving test</p><p>Arguably the test is more difficult because it's based on knowledge and skill, whereas the exam is mostly based on knowledge</p><p>The hard-easy effect makes you overconfident in your ability to pass the test and underconfident about how likely you are to pass the written exam</p><p>As a result, you barely practice driving and focus all your attention on the written exam</p><p>On test day, you easily pass the written exam, but since you were too confident about your driving skills, you fail the driving test</p><p>This matters because we face uncertainty on a daily basis, and in order to effectively navigate the world, we need to act in a rational manner</p><p>The hard-easy effect essentially suggests that we are not being realistic with our abilities and often misplace our confidence</p><p>We can avoid this effect through external feedback or honest self-assessment</p><p><strong>Focusing Illusion</strong></p><p>Nothing is ever as important as what you’re thinking about while you’re thinking about it</p><p>Worrying about a thing makes the thing being worried about seem worse than it is</p><p>As Marcus Aurelius observed, “We suffer more often in imagination than in reality.”</p><p><strong>Reputation Fragility</strong></p><p>Reputations are fragile. A person or business gets judged by the worst of their behaviour, and that makes them vulnerable at any point in time</p><p>As Warren Buffett says: "It takes 20 years to build a reputation and 5 minutes to ruin it.”</p><p><strong>Noise Bottleneck</strong></p><p>We think the more information we consume the more signal we’ll consume</p><p>However, our ability to comprehend the relevant from the irrelevant becomes compromised in this case</p><p>We put too much emphasis on irrelevant data and lose sight of what’s really important</p><p><strong>Serpico Effect</strong></p><p>The tendency to rationalize an action because everyone else is doing it</p><p>Think corporate, government, or police corruption</p><p>Named after Frank Serpico, who became known for whistleblowing on police corruption in the late 1960s and early 1970s</p><p><strong>Compassion Face</strong></p><p>The tendency to have more compassion for victims within small groups than larger groups, because the smaller the group the easier it is to identify individual victims</p><p>One victim can break our hearts while larger groups seem more distanced1</p><p><strong>Three Men Make a Tiger</strong></p><p>The tendency to accept absurd information as long as it's repeated enough times</p><p>If one person tells you there’s a tiger in town, you might assume they’re lying. If two people tell you, you begin to wonder</p><p>If three tell you, you might start running!</p><p><strong>Buridan's Ass</strong></p><p>A type of decision paralysis where two equally good options lead to no decision</p><p>Described by the example of an Ass that's stuck between two stacks of hay of equal size and quality, and can't decide which to eat, causing it to starve to death from indecision</p><p><strong>Semmelweis</strong></p><p>Related to first-conclusion and confirmation bias, the Semmelweis reflex is the tendency to reject new evidence or new information because it contradicts established norms, beliefs, or paradigms</p><p><strong>Mcnamara Fallacy</strong></p><p>The belief that rational decisions are made solely on the basis of quantitative evidence, ignoring all other factors</p><p>Don’t presume that what can’t be measured isn’t really important</p><p><strong>Courtesy Bias</strong></p><p>The resistance to giving an honest opinion due to a desire not to offend the person or organization in question</p><p>Example: Employees hesitant to give an honest opinion to their superiors, clogging information flow for rational decision making in a company</p><p><strong>Lucid Fallacy</strong></p><p>Identified by @nntaleb, the ludic fallacy is the tendency to falsely associate simulations with real life</p><p>Because simulations are designed as “narrow worlds of game and dice”, they fail to account for chaos regarding future events in the real world</p><p><strong>Abilene Paradox (Pluralistic Ignorance)</strong></p><p>The situation where a group decides to make a decision that is counter to the thoughts and feelings of its individual members in the group</p><p>It happens because the members fail to communicate their individual beliefs</p><p><strong>Collective Narcissism</strong></p><p>The tendency to exaggerate the positive image and importance of a group that one belongs to</p><p><strong>Normalcy Bias</strong></p><p>The tendency to believe threats and disasters are not at all probable due to a belief that things will remain as they always have</p><p><strong>Behavioural Inevitability</strong></p><p>The notion that human behavior, and its inherent biases, will always remain</p><p>As Voltaire said: History never repeats itself; man always does</p><p><strong>False Uniqueness Effect</strong></p><p>An attributional cognitive error of assuming that one’s qualities, traits, and personal attributes are unique when in reality they are not</p><p>In essence, it’s the opposite of imposter syndrome</p><p><strong>Positive Illusions</strong></p><p>A form of self-deception that causes individuals to think inflatedly about themselves and their abilities to avoid short-term discomfort or raise self-esteem</p><p>A positive illusion might cause a negative spiral of justifications about worse and worse decisions</p><p><strong>Ironic Process Theory</strong></p><p>The psychological process of attempting to suppress certain thoughts, making those thoughts more likely to resurface in one’s mind</p><p>An example is how when someone is actively trying not to think of a bear they may actually be more likely to imagine one</p><p><strong>Aumann's Agreement Theorem</strong></p><p>The notion that two rational people in an opposing argument can’t and shouldn’t come to the conclusion of agreeing to disagree if they have common knowledge of each other’s beliefs</p><p>In other words, it's a cop out or lazy to settle for this</p><p><strong>Ostrich Effect</strong></p><p>Ostriches bury their heads in the sand to avoid danger. The ostrich effect is the tendency to avoid opposing information to what one desperately wants to be right</p><p>Can mean avoiding believing negative information and allowing a problem to become a bigger problem</p><p><strong>Bounded Rationality</strong></p><p>Limits to the capacity of the mind make it impossible to contain and recall all information obtained, and therefore, rationality is also limited</p><p>This causes us to make choices that are satisfactory rather than optimal (to satisfice, rather than optimize)</p><p><strong>Fluency Heuristic</strong></p><p>Related to the narrative fallacy, fluency heuristic is the tendency to believe more in ideas that are easy to explain rather than those that are hard to comprehend</p><p><strong>Persian Messenger Syndrome</strong></p><p>The act of blaming the bearer of negative news</p><p>Ancient Persians actually killed some messengers whose sole fault was that they brought home truthful bad news, say, of a battle lost</p><p><strong>Okrent's Law</strong></p><p>A law stated by writer Daniel Okrent referring to the phenomenon of the press providing legitimacy to unsupported fringe viewpoints in an effort to appear even-handed</p><p>He once said: The pursuit of balance can create imbalance because sometimes something is true</p><p><strong>Veirordt's Law</strong></p><p>In 1868, German physiologist Karl von Vierordt created this law stating that humans perceive time at different magnitudes over different durations</p><p>We underestimate long periods of time and overestimate short periods of time</p><p><strong>Cunningham's Law</strong></p><p>The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question. It’s to post the wrong answer</p><p>If you express anger in your private conversations, your friends will find you tiresome, but when there’s an audience, outrage can boost status</p><p><strong>Delayed Gratification</strong></p><p>The process an individual undergoes when resisting the temptation of an immediate reward in preference for a later reward</p><p>We live in a world of instant gratification: those who master the power of delayed gratification are the ones who win long term</p><p><strong>Base Rate Neglect</strong></p><p>A tendency to ignore the a priori probability of something by putting heavier weight on appealing information about an individual’s case</p><p>Only 3% of applicants make it into this school, but my daughter is brilliant. I’m sure they’re going to accept her!</p><p><strong>Neglect of Probability</strong></p><p>The tendency to disregard probability in decision making under uncertainty. Small risks are either neglected entirely or hugely overrated</p><p>Hindsight bias is a common result of the tendency to neglect probability</p><p><strong>Friendship Paradox</strong></p><p>Most people have fewer friends than their friends have, on average</p><p>People with more friends are more likely to be one of your friends (sampling bias)</p><p>In reality, it's a contradiction because most people believe they have more friends than their friends have</p><p><strong>Woozle Effect</strong></p><p>When frequent citation of previous information that lacks evidence misleads individuals into believing it’s evidence</p><p>"A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth”</p><p><strong>Ringelmann Effect</strong></p><p>As a group size increases, individuals tend to become increasingly less productive</p><p>Consider a tug of war. As more people are involved, their average performance tends to decrease because each participant feels that their own effort is not critical</p><p><strong>Group Attribution Error</strong></p><p>Falsely assuming that the views and decision outcomes of a collective group reflect the view of each member in that group, even when information is available that indicates that all members do not support the decision</p><p>Closely related to stereotyping</p><p><strong>90-9-1 Rule</strong></p><p>In a social media network (E.g., Twitter), only 1 percent of users will actively create content; another 9 percent will participate by commenting, rating, or sharing the content; and the last 90 percent will watch, look and read without interacting</p><p><strong>Braess's Paradox</strong></p><p>An observation by German mathematician Dietrich Braess who noticed that adding a road to a particular congested road traffic network would make traffic worse due to an increase in shortcuts becoming popular and overcrowded</p><p><strong>Pollyanna Principle</strong></p><p>It’s easier to actively remember pleasant memories than bad ones</p><p>The mind tends to focus on the optimistic at the subconscious level, while it tends to focus on the negative at the conscious level</p><p><strong>Empathy Gap</strong></p><p>Underestimating the way behaviour is largely affected by one’s mental state when you're not currently in that mental state</p><p>If you feel calm, you'll find it difficult to predict how you'll act if someone angers you</p><p><strong>Meat Paradox</strong></p><p>Many of us experience the 'meat paradox', whereby we simultaneously care for animals such as cows, yet also consume them as meat</p><p>Applies to many other moral issues where we stay in the 'dark', to protect the illusion that we are morally consistent and sensible</p><p><strong>Emotional Contagion</strong></p><p>The automatic adoption of the emotional state of another person through observation; some are more susceptible to cues than others</p><p>Happiness and misery love company</p><p>Be careful who you spend your time around, their energy is infectious</p><p><strong>Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation</strong></p><p>Intrinsic arises when you find something personally or intrinsically rewarding, while extrinsic comes from incentives or punishment</p><p>Intrinsic is a better source of long-term motivation, but extrinsic can be used effectively in the short-term</p><p><strong>Big Five Personality Traits</strong></p><p>The most academically accepted model of basic personality traits, sometimes referred to as the OCEAN model: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism</p><p>These factors exist on a continuum and encompass several subfactors</p><p><strong>DISC Model</strong></p><p>A model of human behaviour commonly used in business settings describing four distinct temperaments that can be found in individuals</p><p>D: Dominance</p><p>I: Influence</p><p>S: Steadiness</p><p>C: Compliance</p><p><strong>Instrumental Conditioning</strong></p><p>Occurs when you choose to continue, or discontinue, a behaviour based on the positive or negative reinforcement you've received for that behaviour previously</p><p>Also known as "trial-and-error" learning</p><p><strong>Blind spot</strong></p><p>An area of thought or perception that goes unchecked and can have negative consequences</p><p>Something you systematically overlook either intentionally, but more likely, subconsciously. It leads to a distortion of reality and inferior thinking</p><p><strong>Choice-supportive bias</strong></p><p>The tendency to remember our choices as better than they actually were</p><p>We choose option A over B, we are likely to dismiss faults of A, while amplifying faults of B. Conversely, we'll amplify the advantages of A and de-emphasize those of option B</p><p><strong>Denomination Effect</strong></p><p>We are less likely to spend money in the form of large bills relative to the equivalent amount in smaller bills</p><p>A $50 note has the same value as 10 $5 notes, but we will invariably spend the lower value notes before we even think of touching the $50</p><p><strong>Decoy Effect</strong></p><p>Describes how, when we are choosing between two alternatives, the addition of a third, less attractive option (decoy) can influence our perception of the original two choices</p><p><strong>Distinction Bias</strong></p><p>Describes how, in decision-making, we tend to overvalue the differences between two options when we examine them together</p><p>Conversely, we consider these differences to be less important when we evaluate the options separately</p><p><strong>Duration Neglect</strong></p><p>The psychological principle that the length of an experience has little effect on the memory of that event</p><p>The overall rating is determined by the peak intensity of the experience and the end of the experience (Peak-end rule)</p><p><strong>Endowment effect</strong></p><p>When you place a higher value on an object that you already own compared to the same object if you didn't own it</p><p>Start from zero, what would the product be worth to you if you didn't own it? Don't form emotional attachments without good reason</p><p><strong>Exaggerated expectation</strong></p><p>The tendency to expect or predict more extreme outcomes than those outcomes that actually happen</p><p>Example: worrying about an upcoming public speech and picturing the worst-case scenario. In reality, nothing happens and it's fine.</p><p><strong>Focalism</strong></p><p>The tendency to place too much focus or emphasis on a single factor or piece of information when making judgments or predictions</p><p>“Nothing in life is quite as important as you think it is while you are thinking about it.”</p><p><strong>Illusion of Validity</strong></p><p>The tendency to be overconfident in the accuracy of our judgements, specifically in our interpretations and predictions regarding a given data set</p><p>To cope with the world, we construct narratives that provide a coherent explanation for random occurrences</p><p><strong>Illusory correlation</strong></p><p>When we see an association between two variables (events, actions, ideas, etc.) when they aren’t actually associated</p><p>We tend to overestimate the importance of events we can easily recall and then make associations between them</p><p><strong>Information Bias</strong></p><p>A type of bias or error that can occur when researchers are unable to collect accurate data</p><p>A flaw in measuring exposure, covariate, or outcome variables that results in different quality (accuracy) of information between comparison groups</p><p><strong>Impact bias</strong></p><p>The tendency for people to overestimate the length or the intensity of future emotional states</p><p>You think it will take longer to recover emotionally from disaster than it actually will</p><p><strong>Irrational escalation</strong></p><p>The phenomenon where people increase their investment in a decision despite new evidence suggesting that the decision was probably wrong</p><p>May include money ("throwing good money after bad"), time, or — in the case of military strategy — human lives</p><p><strong>Less-is-better effect</strong></p><p>People sometimes prefer the worse of two options, but only when the options are presented separately</p><p>When people consider both their choices together, their preferences reverse, so that the less-is-better effect disappears</p><p><strong>Money illusion</strong></p><p>The tendency to view wealth and income in nominal dollar terms, rather than recognize their real value, adjusted for inflation</p><p>Inflation matters</p><p><strong>Moral Credential effect</strong></p><p>The subconscious tendency whereby increased confidence and security in one's self-image tends to make you worry less about the consequences of subsequent immoral behavior and, therefore, more likely to make immoral choices and act immorally</p><p><strong>Outcome bias</strong></p><p>An error made in evaluating the quality of a decision when the outcome of that decision is already known</p><p>Involves judging a past decision by its ultimate outcome rather than the quality of the decision at the time it was made, given what was known at that time</p><p><strong>Overconfidence effect</strong></p><p>Where subjective confidence in your own judgments is reliably greater than the objective accuracy of those judgments, especially when confidence is relatively high</p><p>Known as the most "pervasive and potentially catastrophic" of all the cognitive biases</p><p><strong>Pro-innovation bias</strong></p><p>Believing an innovation should be adopted by all of society without the need for close examination of its limitations or weaknesses</p><p>Example: The atomic bomb. Many legislators promoted widespread adoption without close examination of pitfalls and dangers</p><p><strong>Pseudocertainty effect</strong></p><p>The tendency to perceive an outcome as certain when it's actually uncertain in multi-stage decision making</p><p>The evaluation of the certainty of the outcome in a previous stage of decisions is disregarded when selecting an option in subsequent stages</p><p><strong>Reactive devaluation</strong></p><p>The tendency to disparage proposals made by another party, especially if this party is viewed as negative or antagonistic</p><p>We should always assess proposals on their merits, not on their proposer's merits. Further, we should optimise for long-term outcomes</p><p><strong>Restraint bias</strong></p><p>Our tendency to overestimate the level of control we have over our impulsive behaviours</p><p>These urges typically come from “primal impulses” such as hunger, drug cravings, fatigue, or sexual arousal</p><p>Hack: Out of sight, out of mind—take temptation out of view</p><p><strong>Rhyme as a reason effect</strong></p><p>We are more likely to believe statements that contain a rhyme, compared to statements that don't</p><p>"Woes unite foes"</p><p>"Woes unite enemies"</p><p>"Misfortune unites enemies"</p><p>Which seems more believable? Be wary of this in advertising or persuasion</p><p><strong>Selective perception</strong></p><p>The tendency not to notice and more quickly forget stimuli that cause emotional discomfort and contradict our prior beliefs</p><p>Can cause issues when you allow small problems to become bigger problems through a lack of appropriate attention</p><p><strong>Social comparison bias</strong></p><p>The tendency to have feelings of dislike and competitiveness with someone seen as physically or mentally better than oneself</p><p>Remember: We are only competing against our past selves—be better than you were yesterday</p><p><strong>Subadditivity effect</strong></p><p>The tendency to judge the probability of the whole to be less than the probabilities of the parts</p><p>When assigning probabilities to questions or problems, decomposition into small parts to ensure probabilities and risks are understood at a more granular level</p><p><strong>Subjective Validation</strong></p><p>Believing or accepting an idea or statement if it presents to you in a personal and positive way</p><p>Example: you enjoy eating bacon and come across an article that talks about bacon as healthy, you'll believe it more because this "validates" eating more bacon</p><p><strong>Time-saving bias</strong></p><p>Misestimating the time that could be saved (or lost) when increasing (or decreasing) speed</p><p>Not limited to driving, can also apply in areas like healthcare, where we misestimate the effect of adding or subtracting physicians on waiting times</p><p><strong>Road well-travelled effect</strong></p><p>Where travellers (or commuters) estimate the time taken to traverse routes differently depending on their familiarity with the route</p><p>Frequently travelled routes are assessed as taking a shorter time than unfamiliar routes</p><p><strong>Unit Bias</strong></p><p>The tendency to think of a unit (rather than a fraction or %) of something as the appropriate or optimal amount</p><p>If you’ve ever felt you should finish the chapter of the book you were reading before placing it on the nightstand, then you’ve felt the nudge of unit bias</p><p><strong>Zero-sum heuristic</strong></p><p>Judging a situation to be zero-sum (i.e., person A's gain is person B's loss) when it is actually non-zero-sum (both parties can gain together)</p><p>"There’s a false notion that poor countries are poor because rich countries are rich."</p><p>- Michael Miller</p><p><strong>Egocentric bias</strong></p><p>The tendency to rely too heavily on your own point of view when examining events or trying to see things from other people’s perspective</p><p>Example: You overestimate the amount of work that you contributed to a group project</p><p><strong>Extrinsic incentive bias</strong></p><p>The tendency to attribute other people's motives to extrinsic incentives, such as job security or high wages, rather than intrinsic ones, such as learning new things or building a new skill</p><p><strong>Illusion of transparency</strong></p><p>The tendency for people to overestimate the degree to which their personal mental state is known by others</p><p>Also applies to overestimating how well we understand others personal mental states</p><p><strong>Illusion of external agency</strong></p><p>The false belief that good and positive things happen because of external influences rather than personal effort.</p><p>For example, you get good grades in school and attribute that to external variables ("The teacher likes me" or "I got lucky")</p><p><strong>Illusory superiority</strong></p><p>The tendency to overestimate your positive qualities and abilities and to underestimate negative qualities, relative to others</p><p>Applies to intelligence, performance on tasks, and the possession of desirable characteristics or personality traits</p><p><strong>Projection bias</strong></p><p>A self-forecasting error, where we overestimate how much our future selves will share the same beliefs, values and behaviours as our current selves, causing us to make short-sighted decisions</p><p><strong>Trait ascription bias</strong></p><p>The tendency for people to view themselves as relatively variable in terms of personality, behavior and mood while viewing others as much more predictable in their personal traits across different situations</p><p><strong>Worse-than-average effect</strong></p><p>The tendency to underestimate one's achievements and capabilities in relation to others</p><p>Related to imposter syndrome and is the opposite of the usually pervasive better-than-average effect (Dunning-Kruger effect)</p><p><strong>Ultimate Attribution error</strong></p><p>We tend to attribute good acts by friends to their character, and bad acts by friends to situational factors</p><p>For enemies (or people we dislike), it’s reversed: good acts are attributed to situational factors and bad acts to character</p><p><strong>Change bias</strong></p><p>Remembering the past as more difficult than it actually was</p><p>After exerting effort and causing a change in some area, this bias makes you believe your journey and work were more difficult than they actually were</p><p>"When I was a boy... things weren't so easy”</p><p><strong>Childhood amnesia</strong></p><p>The inability of adults to retrieve memories before the age of two to four years, as well as the period before the age of ten, of which some older adults retain fewer memories than might otherwise be expected given the passage of time</p><p><strong>Context effect</strong></p><p>An event is more favourably perceived and remembered when the surrounding environment is comfortable and appealing</p><p><strong>Cross-race effect</strong></p><p>A facial recognition phenomenon in which individuals show superior performance in identifying faces of their own race when compared with memory for faces of another, less familiar race</p><p><strong>Fading affect bias</strong></p><p>The tendency for memories associated with negative emotions to be forgotten more quickly than those associated with positive emotions</p><p>This helps us forget bad experiences more readily</p><p><strong>Generation effect (Self-generation effect)</strong></p><p>The tendency for information to be better remembered when it is self-generated as opposed to passively consumed</p><p>Explains why active recall is one of the most effective learning and retention techniques</p><p><strong>Humor effect</strong></p><p>The tendency for humorous items to be remembered more easily than non-humorous ones</p><p>Potentially explained by the increased cognitive processing time to understand the humor, or the emotional arousal caused by the humor</p><p><strong>Lag effect</strong></p><p>We retain information better when there are longer breaks between repeated presentations of that information</p><p>The lag effect suggests that the longer the time between repetitions of information, the more likely we are to commit that information to memory</p><p><strong>Levelling and sharpening</strong></p><p>Levelling and sharpening are processes we use during memory recollection</p><p>Levelling refers to the tendency to omit minor details and distinctions, whereas sharpening occurs when certain aspects of a memory are exaggerated or made more profound</p><p><strong>List-length effect</strong></p><p>As the length of a list gets longer, a greater number of items are actually remembered</p><p>When you go shopping and forget your list, you remember only a few items—this happens whether it's a short or a long list. If it's long, you'll tend to remember more</p><p><strong>Misinformation effect</strong></p><p>The tendency for post-event information to interfere with the memory of the original event</p><p>For example, if a question contains misleading information, it can distort the memory of an event. This can lead to inaccurate or false memories</p><p><strong>Misattribution of memory effect</strong></p><p>The tendency to remember what took place and the specific piece of information, but not where it came from</p><p>"I've heard about this, but I can't remember where from, so it's hard to justify it”</p><h1>That's it, thanks for reading!</h1><p>If you got value out of this, I’d appreciate you <a href=https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nZXRyZXZ1ZS5jby9wcm9maWxlL2FsZXhicm9nYW4_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPU1lbnRhbCUyME1vZGVscyUyQyUyMENvbmNlcHRzJTJDJTIwYW5kJTIwRnJhbWV3b3JrcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9UmV2dWUlMjBuZXdzbGV0dGVyIiwicG9zdF9pZCI6IjJmNWZiY2MyLTFkNTItNDBiZi05YWFlLWM0N2EwNmQ2OTQxZSIsInB1YmxpY2F0aW9uX2lkIjoiMTM3ZDVlODMtOTUwMy00ZGI3LWE4YzQtZjM0MTVjMjA1NWFlIiwidmlzaXRfdG9rZW4iOiIxMjA0ZWNlNy05ODhmLTRhY2QtYjc4MC0wMzZjMWNlZTEwNmIiLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzg3NDc2MDcuMzY5LCJpc3MiOiJvcmNoaWQifQ.sX0UjLlXSNPUmu7IbDyiKIt3rhFBmo5asQcuesvVj48 target=_blank>sharing it</a> or my <a href=https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3R3aXR0ZXIuY29tL19hbGV4YnJvZ2FuP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1NZW50YWwlMjBNb2RlbHMlMkMlMjBDb25jZXB0cyUyQyUyMGFuZCUyMEZyYW1ld29ya3MmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPVJldnVlJTIwbmV3c2xldHRlciIsInBvc3RfaWQiOiIyZjVmYmNjMi0xZDUyLTQwYmYtOWFhZS1jNDdhMDZkNjk0MWUiLCJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbl9pZCI6IjEzN2Q1ZTgzLTk1MDMtNGRiNy1hOGM0LWYzNDE1YzIwNTVhZSIsInZpc2l0X3Rva2VuIjoiMTIwNGVjZTctOTg4Zi00YWNkLWI3ODAtMDM2YzFjZWUxMDZiIiwiaWF0IjoxNjc4NzQ3NjA3LjM2OSwiaXNzIjoib3JjaGlkIn0.grl5BVENEoRVfQcKCCcmrmj87e02TDtCTmYROLKjFLY target=_blank>Twitter profile</a> on Twitter so others can get wiser too :)</p><p>‍</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://alexbrogan.com/>Alex Brogan</a></span> ·
