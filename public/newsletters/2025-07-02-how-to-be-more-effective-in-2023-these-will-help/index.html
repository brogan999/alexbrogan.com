This is called ‘artificial complexity.’\nDecomplication is the process of boiling problems down to their simplest form. h/t @nateliason\nVia NegativaWhen we have a problem, our natural instinct is to add a new habit or buy a solution.\nBut usually, you improve your life by subtracting instead.\nThe foods you avoid are more important than the foods you eat.\nSubtracting distractions is the key to productivity.\nSpeed MattersThe faster you do things, the less activation energy is required to do any one thing. To avoid procrastination, keep the activation energy low by shortening the timeframe for the work that needs to be done, and work faster. h/t @jsomers\nHourly Aspirational RateFigure out how much an hour of your time is worth: Your 'aspirational hourly' rate.\nWhen deciding whether or not to do a task, ask whether it's worth more or less than your rate.\nIf it's worth less than your rate, outsource, automate, or delete it.\nTrust in Calendar”A calendar speaks more truth than a to-do list.\nYour to-do list is the ideal Sunday evening theory. Your calendar is the brutal Monday to Friday practice.\nOperate accordingly: you must block time in your calendar for deep work.”\nh/t @shreyas\nHigh-Leverage Activities To maximize output, spend time on the activities that will influence that output the most.\nThe more you need to do an activity or the more you are affected by it, the higher the leverage is on time spent perfecting that thing. h/t @rabois\nThe Top Idea In Your MindThe topic you think about in the shower is “The Top Idea In Your Mind.”\nIf it's not what you want to be thinking about, it might indicate your focus isn’t where it should be: on your most important problem.\nIf so, you may need to change something.\nThe Productivity FrontierUp to a point—the productivity frontier—productivity is about optimizing the way you work.\nWhen you reach the frontier, higher achievement results from making hard trade-offs about what you work on.\nFocus and single-tasking are key. h/t @ScottHYoung\nFlow StatesFlow is a heightened state of concentration where time passes without notice and you feel a deep sense of fulfillment in your work.\nHow to get there?\n• Use deadlines\n• Do tasks you enjoy\n• Eliminate distractions\n• Choose tasks that challenge you\nWrite Before ActionWrite down what you plan to do and how you plan to do it (in detail) before you do it. How does this help? • You can see what to delegate easily\n• Unnecessary tasks become obvious • The best approach becomes clearer h/t @Conaw\nProcrastination EquationTo decrease procrastination: • Increase the expectancy of success\n• Increase the value and pleasantness of the task\n• Decrease impulsiveness by removing distractions\n• Decrease the delay of reward through deadlines\nh/t @pierssteel\n2-Minute Rule“If an action will take less than two minutes, it should be done at the moment it’s defined.”\nDon’t let small tasks add up and create a mental overhang.\nDo it on the spot if Attention ResidueEvery time you switch from one task to another, part of your attention remains with one task or your previous task.\nThis prevents you from concentrating intensely ('deep work') and inhibits overall productivity.\nLesson: Don't multi-task.\nCognitive Switching PenaltyEvery time you switch your attention from one subject to another, you incur this penalty.\nYour brain spends time and energy thrashing, loading, and reloading contexts.\nTo avoid unproductive switching, group similar tasks together.\nDeep WorkDeep work is single-tasking, limiting your context switching and distractions in your immediate working environment.\nShallow work is logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted.\nh/t Cal Newport\nHofstadter's LawProjects always take longer than expected, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.\nYou're generally bad at estimating when things will get done.\nThe deeper point: We often have a choice of when to call a project “done.”\nUse this choice more often.\nElon's LawIf you have a project, combat Hofstader's Law by setting a ridiculously ambitious deadline.\nEven if you fail to meet it, you're still ahead.\nIsn’t it better to miss an aggressive deadline than a conservative one?\nIt's no wonder Musk has achieved so much.\nMurphy's Law”Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.”\nThis is another reason to use Elon’s Law.\nWhen planning long-term projects, consider a margin of safety to ensure you can handle any interruptions to planned progress and still meet your deadline easily.\nParkinson's LawWork expands to fill the time allotted to it.\nIf you allocate 4 weeks, it will take 4 weeks. If you allocate 10 days, it will take 10 days.\nRemember: The sooner you finish, the sooner you can move on.\nAdvice: Use artificial deadlines.\nPomodoro TechniqueUse a timer to break down work into intervals of ~25-45mins separated by short breaks—the intervals are called Pomodoro’s.\nThis model taps into Parkinson’s law and causes you to try and get more done within each short time period, with a reward at the end.\nGate's LawWe overestimate what we can do in one year and underestimate what we can do in ten years.\nHumans think in linear terms, so we struggle to contemplate the compounding returns on actions over a decade.\nDon’t be dispirited if 1-year isn’t enough to hit your goals.\nMaker's vs Manager's ScheduleThere are two types of schedules.\nManager: The work you do changes every hour.\nMaker: The work you do requires long, uninterrupted units of time—e.g., programmers.\nFigure out the schedule your role requires to do your best work and stick to it.\nEffectiveness vs. EfficiencyEffectiveness: Doing the right things—getting the result you intend.\nEfficiency: Doing things right—working with minimal waste of time and effort.\nTo achieve more, you must be both effective \u0026 efficient, but effectiveness should come first.\nDiscipline Equals Freedom”Discipline and Freedom seem like they sit on opposite ends of the spectrum, but they are actually very connected. Freedom is what everyone wants.\nBut the only way to get to a place of freedom is through discipline.”\nh/t @jockowillink\nSystems vs. GoalsTo achieve more, focus on the process first—the system—that will get you to the goal.\nDoing something every day is a system—like writing for 1 hour.\nWriting a book is a goal.\n\"Goals determine your direction. Systems determine your progress.”\n—James Clear\nThere you have it, 25 mental models that will make you more effective. I hope you found these as helpful as I have.\nStay curious, Alex\nP.S.
