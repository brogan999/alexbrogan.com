If another party calls your bluff and you don't act, you lose credibility</p><p id=""><strong id="">Carrot &amp; Stick Approach</strong></p><p id="">A promise of a reward (the carrot) and at the same time a threat of punishment (the stick) to deter behavior</p><p id="">Must be strong enough so that the cost of the stick or missing the carrot is too high</p><p id="">Economic sanctions are hotly debated in terms of efficacy</p><p id=""><strong id="">Choke Point</strong></p><p id="">A narrow geographical feature (e.g., Bridge) that a large number of soldiers are forced to pass through to reach their objective</p><p id="">This greatly reduces combat effectiveness by making it harder to bring superior numbers to bear , and empowers an inferior force</p><p id=""><strong id="">Potemkin Village</strong></p><p id="">Something specifically built to convince people that a situation is better than it actually is</p><p id="">The military has employed this model widely, from dummy guns to dummy tanks and even dummy paratroopers</p><p id="">Modern dummies can mimic the heat signature of a real tank</p><p id=""><strong id="">Decapitation</strong></p><p id="">A massive strategic attack on the political and military leadership structures of the opponent with the intention of eliminating or at least significantly reducing its ability to counterattack</p><p id=""><strong id="">Shock and Awe</strong></p><p id="">A strategy of using overwhelming power to try and achieve rapid dominance over the enemy</p><p id="">Its aim is to paralyze the enemy's perception of the battlefield and destroy their will to fight</p><p id=""><strong id="">Swarming</strong></p><p id="">A behavior where autonomous, or semi-autonomous, units of action attack an enemy from several different directions and then regroup</p><p id="">Involves the use of a decentralized force against an opponent, in a manner that emphasizes mobility, unit autonomy and coordination</p><p id=""><strong id="">Turning Movement</strong></p><p id="">Strategy that involves an attacking force seizing objectives behind the enemy's current positions</p><p id="">This causes the enemy force to move out of their current positions or divert major forces to meet the threat, separating them from their main defensive positions</p><p id=""><strong id="">Win Without Fighting</strong></p><p id="">“Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting.” – Sun Tzu</p><p id="">What does this mean? It means achieving objectives with deception, surprise, alliances, and information dominance rather than physical war</p><p id=""><strong id="">Defense in Depth</strong></p><p id="">A strategy in which the defending side spreads its units over a large area so that they gradually absorb the strength of an attacking enemy</p><p id="">Defence in depth relies on the tendency of an attack to lose momentum over time or as it covers a larger area</p><p id=""><strong id="">Fortification</strong></p><p id="">A semi-permanent or permanent defensive structure that gives physical protection to a military unit</p><p id="">Designed for the defense of territories in warfare, and is also used to establish rule in a region during peacetime</p><p id=""><strong id="">Fabian Strategy</strong></p><p id="">A strategy that aims to avoid field battles and frontal attacks by wearing out the opponent instead, e.g. through disruptions in logistics or by affecting morale</p><p id="">Used by warring parties who have time on their side or when there is no other alternative.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Scorched Earth</strong></p><p id="">A tactic used by defending armies that consists of destroying buildings, factories, fields, and the like during a retreat</p><p id="">The purpose is to prevent valuable assets from falling into the hands of the enemy and thus contributing to its resources</p><p id=""><strong id="">Turtling</strong></p><p id="">A strategy that emphasizes heavy defense</p><p id="">Involves hoarding resources and building up heavy defenses, while refusing to risk moving and/or exposing weak spots</p><p id="">Typically involves minimizing losses a là attrition and baiting opponents to attempt an attack118</p><p id=""><strong id="">Lead Domino</strong></p><p id="">A row of dominoes is set up, you knock over the first one, the last one is a certainty to also go over very quickly. Hence, you can't let the first domino fall</p><p id="">Prominent in the 1950s to 1980s (Cold War) where the US used it to justify American Intervention globally</p><p id=""><strong id="">Red Team</strong></p><p id="">Involves using an independent group to challenge a military to improve its effectiveness</p><p id="">Benefits include challenges to preconceived notions and clarifying the problem state that planners are attempting to mitigate</p><p id="">Sometimes called alternative analysis</p><p id=""><strong id="">Fog of War</strong></p><p id="">War is the realm of uncertainty. It becomes confusing and distorted as soon as it begins, so you can't rely on the original plan</p><p id="">This strategy involves preserving optionality. Keeping options open until there is more situational clarity from better information</p><p id=""><strong id="">Deterrence</strong></p><p id="">Using a threat to prevent (deter) an action by an adversary (E.g., threatening Nuclear action)</p><p id="">Can be appropriate when you want to try to prevent another person or organization from taking an action that would be harmful to you or society at large</p><p id=""><strong id="">Call Your Bluff</strong></p><p id="">A counter-strategy to a zero-tolerance policy. Involves challenging the other party to act on their threat, claim, or policy, and actually prove it is true, calling them out</p><p id="">If the called out party doesn't follow through, they risk losing credibility</p><p id=""><strong id="">Burn The Boats</strong></p><p id="">An action which forces you to continue with a particular course, and makes it impossible for you to return to an earlier situation</p><p id="">Leaving only one path forward can have the effect of enhancing motivation and focus, increasing the likelihood of success</p><h1 id="">The 36 Chinese Stratagems for War</h1><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63fd511e232de229bfe66c52/640faf5cc82bd514554449a2_FN5KuyHWUAENrMk.jpeg" id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p id="">The 36 Chinese Stratagems for War are a playbook for misdirection, deceit, and dominance. They can be applied in War, Politics, Business, and Life.</p><p id=""><strong id="">The Strategems have six categories:</strong></p><ol id=""><li id="">Stratagems When Commanding Superiority</li><li id="">Stratagems for Confrontation</li><li id="">Stratagems for Attack</li><li id="">Stratagems for Confused Situations</li><li id="">Stratagems for Gaining Ground</li><li id="">Stratagems for Desperate Straits</li></ol><p id=""><strong id="">Stratagems When Commanding Superiority (Winning Strategies)</strong></p><p id=""><strong id="">1. Deceive The Heavens And Cross The Ocean</strong></p><p id="">Mask one's real goals from those in authority who lack vision by not alerting them to one's movements or any part of one's plan.</p><p id="">Act in the open, but hide true intentions.</p><p id=""><strong id="">2. Besiege Wei To Rescue Zhao</strong></p><p id="">When the enemy is too strong to be attacked directly, then attack something he holds dear. Attack their Achilles heel.</p><p id="">Somewhere there is a gap in the armour, a weakness that can be attacked instead.</p><p id=""><strong id="">3. Kill With A Borrowed Sword</strong></p><p id="">Attack using the strength of another (in a situation where using one's own strength is not favourable).</p><p id="">Trick an ally into attacking him, bribe an official to turn traitor, or use the enemy's own strength against him.</p><p id=""><strong id="">4. Wait At Leisure While The Enemy Labors</strong></p><p id="">Have your troops well-prepared for battle while the enemy expends energy, ideally resulting in their exhausted troops running into your fresh soldiers on the terms of your choosing.</p><p id="">When this happens, attack with energy and purpose.</p><p id=""><strong id="">5. Loot A Burning House</strong></p><p id="">When a country is beset by internal conflicts, when disease and famine ravage the population, when corruption and crime are rampant, then it will be unable to deal with an outside threat.</p><p id="">This is the time to attack. Hit them when they are down.</p><p id=""><strong id="">6. Make A Sound In The East, Then Strike In The West</strong></p><p id="">Manipulate the enemy to focus their resources somewhere before attacking elsewhere that is poorly defended.</p><p id="">Fake to the right; attack to the left. Surprise can provide an overwhelming advantage.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Stratagems for Confrontation (Enemy Dealing Strategies)</strong></p><p id=""><strong id="">7. Create Something From Nothing</strong></p><p id="">Make somebody believe there was something substantial when there is in fact nothing, or vice versa.</p><p id="">Create an illusion of something's existence, while it does not exist, or vice versa.</p><p id=""><strong id="">8. Openly Repair The Walkway, But Sneak Through The Passage Of Chencang</strong></p><p id="">Deceive the enemy with an obvious approach, while surprising him by taking a shortcut and sneaking up on him.</p><p id="">In business, pretend to care about an issue and later give it up to get what you really want.</p><p id=""><strong id="">9. Watch The Fires Burning From Across The River</strong></p><p id="">Delay entering the field of battle until all the other players have become exhausted fighting amongst themselves. Then go in at full strength and pick up the pieces.</p><p id="">Classic example: The United States in the First World War.</p><p id=""><strong id="">10. Hide A Knife Behind A Smile</strong></p><p id="">Charm and ingratiate yourself to your enemy. When you have gained his trust, move against him in secret.</p><p id="">Befriend them to get their guard down, then attack their weakest point.</p><p id=""><strong id="">11. Sacrifice A Plum Tree To Preserve The Peach Tree</strong></p><p id="">Sacrifice short-term objectives in order to gain the long-term goal. This is the scapegoat strategy whereby someone else suffers the consequences so that the rest do not.</p><p id="">Trade up! Take a small loss for a large gain.</p><p id=""><strong id="">12. Take The Opportunity To Pilfer A Goat</strong></p><p id="">While carrying out one's plans, be flexible enough to take advantage of any opportunity that presents itself, however small, and avail oneself of any profit, however slight.</p><p id="">Alertly exploit every small opportunity along the way.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Stratagems for Attack (Attack Strategies)</strong></p><p id=""><strong id="">13. Stomp The Grass To Scare The Snake</strong></p><p id="">Do something unaimed, but spectacular to provoke a response of the enemy, thereby giving away his plans or position.</p><p id="">Stir things up before beginning to negotiate for your true interests</p><p id=""><strong id="">14. Borrow A Corpse To Resurrect The Soul</strong></p><p id="">Revive something from the past by giving it a new purpose or bring to life old ideas, customs, or traditions and reinterpret them to fit your purposes.</p><p id="">Revive a dead proposal by presenting it again or in a new way.</p><p id=""><strong id="">15. Lure The Tiger Off Its Mountain Lair</strong></p><p id="">Never directly attack an opponent whose advantage is derived from their position. Instead, lure them away from their position to separate them from their source of strength.</p><p id="">Seek a neutral location. Negotiate here only.</p><p id=""><strong id="">16. In Order To Capture, One Must Let Loose</strong></p><p id="">Cornered prey will often mount a final desperate attack. To prevent this, you let the enemy believe he still has a chance for freedom.</p><p id="">This may also give you more information about their capabilities and intentions.</p><p id=""><strong id="">17. Toss Out A Brick To Obtain The Jade</strong></p><p id="">Bait someone by making him believe he gains something or just make him react to it ("toss out a brick") and obtain something valuable from him in return ("get a jade gem").</p><p id="">Trade something of minor value for something of major value.</p><p id=""><strong id="">18. Defeat The Enemy By Capturing Their Chief</strong></p><p id="">If the enemy's army is strong but is allied to the commander only by money, superstition or threats, then take aim at the leader.</p><p id="">If the commander falls the rest of the army will disperse or come over to your side.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Stratagems for Confused Situations (Chaos Strategies)</strong></p><p id=""><strong id="">19. Remove The Firewood From Under The Pot</strong></p><p id="">Take out the leading argument or asset of your target, denying your enemy the resources needed to oppose you.</p><p id="">Eliminate the source of their strength.</p><p id=""><strong id="">20. Disturb The Water And Catch A Fish</strong></p><p id="">Create confusion and use this confusion to further your own goals. In chaos, it is easier to seize power.</p><p id="">Do something surprising or unexpected to unnerve them, and then take advantage of that situation.</p><p id=""><strong id="">21. Slough Off The Cicada's Golden Shell</strong></p><p id="">Create an illusion to fit your goals and distract others. Mask yourself. Either leave one's distinctive traits behind, thus becoming inconspicuous, or masquerade as something or someone else.</p><p id="">When you are in trouble, secretly escape.</p><p id=""><strong id="">22. Shut The Door To Catch The Thief</strong></p><p id="">To capture or to deliver the final blow to your enemy, you must plan prudently. Do not rush into action.</p><p id="">Completely destroy them by leaving no way for escape. Cut off any escape routes or routes through which outside help can reach them.</p><p id=""><strong id="">23. Befriend A Distant State while attacking a Neighbor</strong></p><p id="">When you are the strongest in one field, your greatest threat is from the second strongest in your field, not the strongest from another field.</p><p id="">Distant neighbors make good allies, however temporary.</p><p id=""><strong id="">24. Obtain Safe Passage To Conquer The State Of Guo</strong></p><p id="">Borrow the resources of an ally or temporarily join forces with them to attack a common enemy.</p><p id="">Once the enemy is defeated, use those resources to turn on the ally that lent you them in the first place.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Stratagems for Gaining Ground (Proximate Strategies)</strong></p><p id=""><strong id="">25. Replace The Beams With Rotten Timbers</strong></p><p id="">Sabotage, incapacitate, or change the rules that an enemy is used to following to remove their key support and destroy them.</p><p id=""><strong id="">26. Point At The Mulberry Tree While Cursing The Locust Tree</strong></p><p id="">Use indirect means of getting your way or of showing what you mean or want. Criticize indirectly from a safe position.</p><p id="">Do not name names so you cannot be accused. Use intermediaries, third parties and others.</p><p id=""><strong id="">27. Feign Madness But Keep Your Balance</strong></p><p id="">Hide behind the mask of a fool, a drunk, or a madman to create confusion about your intentions and motivations.</p><p id="">Lure your opponent into underestimating your ability until, overconfident, he drops his guard. Then you may attack.</p><p id=""><strong id="">28. Lure Them Onto The Roof, Then Take Away The Ladder</strong></p><p id="">With baits and deceptions, lure your enemy into a trap (e.g., treacherous terrain), then cut off their escape (e.g., lines of communication).</p><p id=""><strong id="">29. Deck The Tree With False Blossoms</strong></p><p id="">Through the use of trickery, make something of no value appear valuable.</p><p id="">Reframe deceitfully. Expand the pie with objects of little value.</p><p id=""><strong id="">30. Make The Host And The Guest Exchange Roles</strong></p><p id="">Pretend to be a guest to be accepted, make them dependent on you, then develop from the inside and become dominant.</p><p id="">Turn your defensive and passive position into an offensive and active one.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Stratagems for Desperate Straits (Defeat Strategies)</strong></p><p id=""><strong id="">31. The Beauty Trap</strong></p><p id="">Also known as the Honey Trap. Distract the enemy with beauty.</p><p id="">Provide alluring distractions so the enemy neglects their duties and allows their vigilance to wane.</p><p id=""><strong id="">32. The Empty Fort Strategy</strong></p><p id="">When the enemy is superior in numbers and you expect to be overrun at any moment, then drop all signs of military preparedness.</p><p id="">Act calm and at ease when your enemy expects you to be tense. Put on a bold front, fake strength.</p><p id=""><strong id="">33. Let The Enemy's Own Spy Sow Discord In The Enemy Camp</strong></p><p id="">Undermine your enemy's intelligence-gathering abilities by using his own spies against him or planting your own agents among his.</p><p id="">Provide inaccurate information to mislead them, especially through informal channels.</p><p id=""><strong id="">34. Injure Yourself To Gain The Enemy's trust</strong></p><p id="">The enemy is lulled into relaxing since they no longer consider you to be an immediate threat, or you can make them believe it was caused by a mutual enemy.</p><p id="">Appear to take some hits. Feign weakness while arming yourself.</p><p id=""><strong id="">35. Chain Stratagems</strong></p><p id="">Use several stratagems applied simultaneously, or one after another as in a chain of stratagems.</p><p id="">Keep different plans operating in an overall scheme; however, in this manner if any one strategy fails, then the chain breaks and the whole scheme fails.</p><p id=""><strong id="">36. If All Else Fails, Retreat</strong></p><p id="">Run away to fight another day. As long as you are not defeated, you still have a chance.</p><p id="">This is the most famous of the stratagems, immortalized in the form of a Chinese idiom: "Of the Thirty-Six Stratagems, fleeing is best”</p><h1 id="">That’s it, thanks for reading!</h1><p>‍</p>
