My hope is that this change makes the content more consumable.\nAs always, if you get value out of this, I’d appreciate you sharing it or my Twitter profile on Twitter so others can get value out of it too :)\nWithout further ado, let's get into it!\nPsychology \u0026 General Thinking ConceptsModality effect\nYou'll tend to remember more when using a mixed-mode (partly visual and partly auditory) of learning compared to a single-mode (either visual or auditory alone)\nWhen information is presented in multiple modalities, total working memory capacity is increased\nNext-in-line effect\nThe tendency to have lower recall for events that happen right before or after a public performance—whether performing on stage or talking to a group of other people\nThis effect is believed to occur due to both attention distraction and retrograde amnesia\nPlacement bias\nThe tendency to be influenced by story placement in the news in a way that downplays information supportive of a minority viewpoint\nAs a general rule, story placement is a measure of how important the editor considers the story\nPicture superiority effect\nThe tendency for pictures and images to be remembered more easily than words\nOccurs because our brains dually encode images, but encode words only once. This means that images are stored as pictures and words, but words are only stored as words\nPositivity effect\nThe tendency for elderly people to perceive and remember positive images and experiences more than negative ones\nA form of selective memory that helps compensate for troubles that occur over the lifetime\nProcessing difficulty effect\nWe have an easier time remembering information that takes longer to read and understand\nThis feels counter-intuitive: we want to make our message simple and short, right? In some cases, yes. But, not all. Making the brain work is a powerful tool\nRosy retrospection\nOur tendency to recall the past more fondly than the present\nAn inaccurate view of past events might lead to judging current or future events unfairly. And without storing negative experiences, you may fail to incorporate constructive feedback\nReminiscence bump\nThe tendency for older adults (over forty) to have increased or enhanced recollection for events that occurred during their adolescence and early adulthood\nOccurs because memory storage in autobiographical memory is not consistent through time\nSelf-relevance effect\nA tendency to encode information differently depending on whether we are implicated in the information\nWhen we are asked to remember information when it is related in some way to ourselves, the recall rate can be improved\nSource Confusion\nA type of memory error where we don't remember where certain memories come from\nDangerous because when we disassociate the content of our knowledge from the source, we become similarly confident in all content despite not being confident in all sources\nSuffix effect\nThe tendency to be unable to recall the final items from a spoken list when the list is followed by an unnecessary or irrelevant speech item or suffix\nOccurs because the mind fixates on the very end of the list, even if it's not actually part of the list\nSpacing effect\nThe tendency for learning to be more effective when study sessions are spaced out\nExplains why cramming doesn't lead to long-term memory retention, and why repeated exposure over a longer period of time typically does\nTelescoping effect\nRefers to inaccurate perceptions regarding time, where people see recent events as more remote than they are (backward telescoping), and remote events as more recent (forward telescoping)\nCan occur whenever we make temporal assumptions regarding past events\nTesting effect\nThe tendency for long-term memory to be increased when some of the learning period is devoted to retrieving information from memory—in other words, devoted to 'active recall'\nFlashcard software like Anki is an application of this\nTip-of-the-tongue phenomenon\nThe experience of feeling confident that one knows an answer, yet is unable to produce the word\nThe effect tends to develop with age, but can be mitigated through diet, exercise, socialisation, and games related to words such as scrabble\nVerbatim effect\nPeople remember the gist of information, which is its general meaning, better than they remember its exact form\nThis has important implications for presenting information. We should preference storytelling over facts or statistics, they'll stick better\nVon Restorff effect\nAn item that “stands out like a sore thumb” is more likely to be remembered or preferenced than other items\nTakeaway: Make important information visually distinctive\nSubselves\nWe use different mental processes in different situations, so each of us is not a single character but a collection of different characters, who take turns to commandeer the mind depending on the situation. There is a work “you”, a friend “you”, an online “you”, etc.\nNudging\nThe tendency for positive reinforcement or indirect suggestions to influence behaviour and decision-making\nA 'nudge' makes it more likely that an individual will make a particular choice, or behave in a particular way; be wary of what or who is nudging you\nClanning\nThe tendency of humans group naturally around important issues, positions, or events\nUnderstand the group dynamic, or you’re likely to be caught up in it\nMeehl Pattern\nWhen an expert in a field tries to predict something complicated but has a lower success rate doing so than a simple statistical formula (or ‘algorithm’)\nSometimes experts overcomplicate explanations instead of relying on simple data (The Curse of Knowledge)\nThousands of You\nThe tendency to assume that we're one person in everyone else's mind when in reality, a different version of us exists in the minds of everyone who knows us\nThe person you think of as \"yourself\" exists only for you, and even you don't really know who that is\nAsch Negative\nA theory explaining social conformity\nIf someone is Asch positive, they follow the crowd over what they believe to be true\nIf someone is Asch negative, they follow what they believe to be true regardless of the crowd's opinion\nEnantiodromia\nAn excess of something can give rise to its opposite. Excess builds up tension, and the more extreme the position, the more easily it can shift to its opposite\nE.g. A society that is too liberal will be tolerant of tyrants, who will eventually make it illiberal\nProtect Yourself From Bad Advice\nPeople tend to be most motivated by incentives. \"Show me the incentives, and I'll show you the outcome.\"\nWhen receiving advice from someone—a salesman, colleague, or even acquaintances—always remember what the adviser's personal incentives are\nInfluence Yourself\nA follow-on from the above: If you can determine the specific incentives that motivate you the most, you can hack your own motivation\nIs it money? Status or prestige? Responsibility? Freedom? Whatever it is, figure it out and make them your main incentive\nDoubt/Avoidance Tendency\nThe tendency to make quick, poorly thought-out decisions during stressful situations\nThe pressure to remove doubt causes you to make ill-informed choices\nControl by scheduling deliberate delays when stressed to strategize before reaching a decision\nEgo Depletion\nThe idea that willpower draws upon a limited pool of mental resources that can be used up\nWhen the energy for mental activity is low, self-control is typically impaired, which would be considered a state of ego depletion\nMinimise inconsequential decisions\nMisattribution of Arousal\nPeople make mistakes in assuming what's causing them to feel aroused\nFor example, when actually experiencing physiological responses related to fear, people mislabel those responses as romantic arousal\nKnowing the source of arousal is important\nIllusion of Asymmetric Insight\nThe tendency to feel like you know everyone else far better than they know you, and not only that, but you know them better than they know themselves\nThis illusion clouds your ability to see the people you disagree with as nuanced and complex\nEnclothed Cognition\nThe systematic influence that clothes have on our psychological processes\nClothing can enhance our psychological states, and it can improve our performance on tasks\nAsk yourself, “Which clothing makes you feel [fierce, confident, composed, free…]?\nDeindividuation\nA state when you become so immersed in the norms of the group that you lose your sense of identity and personal responsibility, which can ultimately lead to unsociable or \"mob-like\" behaviour\nAnonymity and diffusion of responsibility act strongly here\nOverjustification Effect\nA phenomenon in which getting paid for doing what you already enjoy will sometimes cause your love for the task to wane because you attribute your motivation as coming from the reward, not your internal feelings\nSelf-Enhancement Bias\nThe tendency to protect unrealistic attitudes about your abilities in order to stay sane and avoid despair. Involves rating ourselves more highly than social norms would predict\nPriming\nEvery idea you experience now unconsciously influences all the ideas you experience later. Those ideas then influence your behavior without your realizing it\nWith awareness, we can remain conscious of how previous experiences may influence our present decision-making\nConfabulation\nConfabulation is a type of memory error in which gaps in a person's memory are unconsciously filled with fabricated, misinterpreted, or distorted information\nWhen someone confabulates, they are confusing things they have imagined with real memories\nProcrastination\nThe Myth: You procrastinate because you are lazy and can’t manage your time well\nThe Truth: Procrastination is fueled by weakness in the face of impulse and a failure to think about thinking\nWhat's more important, your current impulses or your future life?\nIntrospection Illusion\nBelieving you understand your motivations and desires, your likes and dislikes. You believe you know yourself and why you are the way you are\nHowever, the truth is that when pressed to explain your emotional states, you'll typically make something up\nBrand Loyalty\nA tendency to believe that you prefer the things you own over the things you don't because you made rational choices when you bought them\nIn reality, you prefer them because you rationalise your past choices to protect your sense of self\nArgument from ignorance\nThe tendency to decide something is true or false because you can't find evidence to the contrary. You don't know what the truth is, so you assume any explanation is as good as another\nThis makes us more likely to accept strange explanations\nCult Indoctrination\nThe propensity for our innate human tendencies to make us susceptible to becoming part of a group that resembles a cult (or is a cult)\nThe term \"cult\" is hard to define, so we may fall into one without consciously knowing it\nSupernormal Releasers\nIf you associate something with survival, but find an example of that thing that is more perfect than anything your ancestors could have ever dreamed of—it will overstimulate you\nExamples for humans are: junk food, the Internet, TV, and video games\nAffect Heuristic\nThe tendency to rely on our emotions, rather than concrete information, when making decisions\nIt allows us to reach a conclusion quickly and easily, but can also distort our thinking and lead us to make suboptimal choices\nSelling Out\nSelling out is an expression for the compromising of a person's integrity in exchange for personal gain, such as money\nThis model reflects the idea that both consumerism and capitalism are driven by competition among consumers for status, rather than profit-seekers\nCatharsis\nThe tendency for \"venting\" (releasing strong emotions) to—counterintuitively—lead to sustained strong emotions and aggressive behaviour rather than relief from strong emotions\nIf you get accustomed to blowing off steam, you become dependent on it\nConformity\nThe mistaken belief that we are strong individuals who don't conform unless forced to. In reality, it takes little more than an authority figure or social pressure for us to conform\nNever be afraid to question authority when your actions could cause harm\nExtinction Burst\nWhen your brain makes a last-ditch effort to return you to a bad habit after you quit it\nTo give up bad habits; overeating, smoking, or gambling, we must be prepared to look for alternative rewards or positive reinforcement, and we should expect resistance\nEmbodied Cognition\nOur physical settings prime us to see the world a certain way. We translate our physical worlds into words, and then believe those words\nWe believe our opinions of people and events are objective, but they are often influenced by the environment around us\nSelf-Handicapping\nInvolves investments in a future reality in which you can blame your failure on something other than your ability\nWhen the fear of failure is strong enough, we like to see new ways to blame possible failures on forces beyond our control to protect our egos\nSelf-Fulfilling Prophecies\nA positive outlook will lead to positive predictions, and you will start to unconsciously manipulate your behaviour and actions to deliver those predictions\nThings you think are true will become reality if given enough time to fester\nThe Moment\nWe believe we are one person, and our happiness is based on being content with our lives\nIn reality, we are multiple selves, and to be happy now and content later, we can't be focused only on reaching goals, because once we reach them, the experience ends\nCaveman Syndrome\nHumans are optimized for a world that existed 100,000 years ago, not for the world today\nFood is everywhere; predators are not\nWe use to be in constant motion; now we sit behind desks at a computer\nAnxiety from overstimulation is rampant\nHow to counteract? 👇\nPerformance Requirements\nIf you don’t give your body what it needs to run, you’ll won't function as well as you can\nBasic tips:\nExercise regularlyGet enough sunlightEat high-quality foodGet at least 7-8 hours of sleepAvoid social media at the start of your dayThe Onion Brain\nOur brains are made up of layers of internal voices that consistently change modes; excitement, concern, calmness\nTo be effective, we need to dissociate ourselves from the voices and realise that they are only an automatic reaction to our surrounding environment\nPerceptual Control\nWe act to keep our perception of the world within acceptable boundaries\nOnce a certain action brings our perception under control, we stop acting until the system is once again out of control\nControl is about adjusting to environmental changes as they happen\nReference Level\nAt the heart of every Perceptual Control system is a Reference Level-a range of perceptions that indicate the system is “under control”\nWhen a perception is within the system’s reference level, nothing happens, when it isn't, change occurs\nConservation of Energy\nHumans have evolved to avoid expending energy unless it's necessary\nUnless a Reference Level is violated, we'll \"conserve energy\" by not acting\nCan explain why people stay in marginally satisfying jobs for decades, it's \"good enough\" but not great\nGuiding Structure\nThe structure of our environment is the largest determinant of our behavior\nIf you want to successfully change a behavior, change the structure that influences or supports the behavior first, and the behavior will follow—don't rely on willpower alone\nReorganization\nOccurs when a Reference Level is violated, but you don’t know how to bring the system back under control\nThis is what happens when people feel “unhappy with their jobs”, or have the “quarter-life crisis”\nThere’s something wrong, but it’s hard to know what\nConflict\nOccurs when two control systems try to change the same perception. This is what happens in the typical case of procrastination: one system wants to rest, and one wants to work\nConflicts can only be solved by changing Reference Levels: how success is defined\nThat's it, thanks for reading!\nIf you got value out of this, I’d appreciate you sharing it or my Twitter profile on Twitter so others can get wiser too :)\n","wordCount":"2659","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-07-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-07-02T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://alexbrogan.com/newsletters/2025-07-02-modality-effect-next-in-line-effect-placement-bias-more/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Alex Brogan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://alexbrogan.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://alexbrogan.com/ accesskey=h title="Alex Brogan (Alt + H)">Alex Brogan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

And without storing negative experiences, you may fail to incorporate constructive feedback</p><p><strong>Reminiscence bump</strong></p><p>The tendency for older adults (over forty) to have increased or enhanced recollection for events that occurred during their adolescence and early adulthood</p><p>Occurs because memory storage in autobiographical memory is not consistent through time</p><p><strong>Self-relevance effect</strong></p><p>A tendency to encode information differently depending on whether we are implicated in the information</p><p>When we are asked to remember information when it is related in some way to ourselves, the recall rate can be improved</p><p><strong>Source Confusion</strong></p><p>A type of memory error where we don't remember where certain memories come from</p><p>Dangerous because when we disassociate the content of our knowledge from the source, we become similarly confident in all content despite not being confident in all sources</p><p><strong>Suffix effect</strong></p><p>The tendency to be unable to recall the final items from a spoken list when the list is followed by an unnecessary or irrelevant speech item or suffix</p><p>Occurs because the mind fixates on the very end of the list, even if it's not actually part of the list</p><p><strong>Spacing effect</strong></p><p>The tendency for learning to be more effective when study sessions are spaced out</p><p>Explains why cramming doesn't lead to long-term memory retention, and why repeated exposure over a longer period of time typically does</p><p><strong>Telescoping effect</strong></p><p>Refers to inaccurate perceptions regarding time, where people see recent events as more remote than they are (backward telescoping), and remote events as more recent (forward telescoping)</p><p>Can occur whenever we make temporal assumptions regarding past events</p><p><strong>Testing effect</strong></p><p>The tendency for long-term memory to be increased when some of the learning period is devoted to retrieving information from memory—in other words, devoted to 'active recall'</p><p>Flashcard software like Anki is an application of this</p><p><strong>Tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon</strong></p><p>The experience of feeling confident that one knows an answer, yet is unable to produce the word</p><p>The effect tends to develop with age, but can be mitigated through diet, exercise, socialisation, and games related to words such as scrabble</p><p><strong>Verbatim effect</strong></p><p>People remember the gist of information, which is its general meaning, better than they remember its exact form</p><p>This has important implications for presenting information. We should preference storytelling over facts or statistics, they'll stick better</p><p><strong>Von Restorff effect</strong></p><p>An item that “stands out like a sore thumb” is more likely to be remembered or preferenced than other items</p><p>Takeaway: Make important information visually distinctive</p><p><strong>Subselves</strong></p><p>We use different mental processes in different situations, so each of us is not a single character but a collection of different characters, who take turns to commandeer the mind depending on the situation. There is a work “you”, a friend “you”, an online “you”, etc.</p><p><strong>Nudging</strong></p><p>The tendency for positive reinforcement or indirect suggestions to influence behaviour and decision-making</p><p>A 'nudge' makes it more likely that an individual will make a particular choice, or behave in a particular way; be wary of what or who is nudging you</p><p><strong>Clanning</strong></p><p>The tendency of humans group naturally around important issues, positions, or events</p><p>Understand the group dynamic, or you’re likely to be caught up in it</p><p><strong>Meehl Pattern</strong></p><p>When an expert in a field tries to predict something complicated but has a lower success rate doing so than a simple statistical formula (or ‘algorithm’)</p><p>Sometimes experts overcomplicate explanations instead of relying on simple data (The Curse of Knowledge)</p><p><strong>Thousands of You</strong></p><p>The tendency to assume that we're one person in everyone else's mind when in reality, a different version of us exists in the minds of everyone who knows us</p><p>The person you think of as "yourself" exists only for you, and even you don't really know who that is</p><p><strong>Asch Negative</strong></p><p>A theory explaining social conformity</p><p>If someone is Asch positive, they follow the crowd over what they believe to be true</p><p>If someone is Asch negative, they follow what they believe to be true regardless of the crowd's opinion</p><p><strong>Enantiodromia</strong></p><p>An excess of something can give rise to its opposite. Excess builds up tension, and the more extreme the position, the more easily it can shift to its opposite</p><p>E.g. A society that is too liberal will be tolerant of tyrants, who will eventually make it illiberal</p><p><strong>Protect Yourself From Bad Advice</strong></p><p>People tend to be most motivated by incentives. "Show me the incentives, and I'll show you the outcome."</p><p>When receiving advice from someone—a salesman, colleague, or even acquaintances—always remember what the adviser's personal incentives are</p><p><strong>Influence Yourself</strong></p><p>A follow-on from the above: If you can determine the specific incentives that motivate you the most, you can hack your own motivation</p><p>Is it money? Status or prestige? Responsibility? Freedom? Whatever it is, figure it out and make them your main incentive</p><p><strong>Doubt/Avoidance Tendency</strong></p><p>The tendency to make quick, poorly thought-out decisions during stressful situations</p><p>The pressure to remove doubt causes you to make ill-informed choices</p><p>Control by scheduling deliberate delays when stressed to strategize before reaching a decision</p><p><strong>Ego Depletion</strong></p><p>The idea that willpower draws upon a limited pool of mental resources that can be used up</p><p>When the energy for mental activity is low, self-control is typically impaired, which would be considered a state of ego depletion</p><p>Minimise inconsequential decisions</p><p><strong>Misattribution of Arousal</strong></p><p>People make mistakes in assuming what's causing them to feel aroused</p><p>For example, when actually experiencing physiological responses related to fear, people mislabel those responses as romantic arousal</p><p>Knowing the source of arousal is important</p><p><strong>Illusion of Asymmetric Insight</strong></p><p>The tendency to feel like you know everyone else far better than they know you, and not only that, but you know them better than they know themselves</p><p>This illusion clouds your ability to see the people you disagree with as nuanced and complex</p><p><strong>Enclothed Cognition</strong></p><p>The systematic influence that clothes have on our psychological processes</p><p>Clothing can enhance our psychological states, and it can improve our performance on tasks</p><p>Ask yourself, “Which clothing makes you feel [fierce, confident, composed, free…]?</p><p><strong>Deindividuation</strong></p><p>A state when you become so immersed in the norms of the group that you lose your sense of identity and personal responsibility, which can ultimately lead to unsociable or "mob-like" behaviour</p><p>Anonymity and diffusion of responsibility act strongly here</p><p><strong>Overjustification Effect</strong></p><p>A phenomenon in which getting paid for doing what you already enjoy will sometimes cause your love for the task to wane because you attribute your motivation as coming from the reward, not your internal feelings</p><p><strong>Self-Enhancement Bias</strong></p><p>The tendency to protect unrealistic attitudes about your abilities in order to stay sane and avoid despair. Involves rating ourselves more highly than social norms would predict</p><p><strong>Priming</strong></p><p>Every idea you experience now unconsciously influences all the ideas you experience later. Those ideas then influence your behavior without your realizing it</p><p>With awareness, we can remain conscious of how previous experiences may influence our present decision-making</p><p><strong>Confabulation</strong></p><p>Confabulation is a type of memory error in which gaps in a person's memory are unconsciously filled with fabricated, misinterpreted, or distorted information</p><p>When someone confabulates, they are confusing things they have imagined with real memories</p><p><strong>Procrastination</strong></p><p>The Myth: You procrastinate because you are lazy and can’t manage your time well</p><p>The Truth: Procrastination is fueled by weakness in the face of impulse and a failure to think about thinking</p><p>What's more important, your current impulses or your future life?</p><p><strong>Introspection Illusion</strong></p><p>Believing you understand your motivations and desires, your likes and dislikes. You believe you know yourself and why you are the way you are</p><p>However, the truth is that when pressed to explain your emotional states, you'll typically make something up</p><p><strong>Brand Loyalty</strong></p><p>A tendency to believe that you prefer the things you own over the things you don't because you made rational choices when you bought them</p><p>In reality, you prefer them because you rationalise your past choices to protect your sense of self</p><p><strong>Argument from ignorance</strong></p><p>The tendency to decide something is true or false because you can't find evidence to the contrary. You don't know what the truth is, so you assume any explanation is as good as another</p><p>This makes us more likely to accept strange explanations</p><p><strong>Cult Indoctrination</strong></p><p>The propensity for our innate human tendencies to make us susceptible to becoming part of a group that resembles a cult (or is a cult)</p><p>The term "cult" is hard to define, so we may fall into one without consciously knowing it</p><p><strong>Supernormal Releasers</strong></p><p>If you associate something with survival, but find an example of that thing that is more perfect than anything your ancestors could have ever dreamed of—it will overstimulate you</p><p>Examples for humans are: junk food, the Internet, TV, and video games</p><p><strong>Affect Heuristic</strong></p><p>The tendency to rely on our emotions, rather than concrete information, when making decisions</p><p>It allows us to reach a conclusion quickly and easily, but can also distort our thinking and lead us to make suboptimal choices</p><p><strong>Selling Out</strong></p><p>Selling out is an expression for the compromising of a person's integrity in exchange for personal gain, such as money</p><p>This model reflects the idea that both consumerism and capitalism are driven by competition among consumers for status, rather than profit-seekers</p><p><strong>Catharsis</strong></p><p>The tendency for "venting" (releasing strong emotions) to—counterintuitively—lead to sustained strong emotions and aggressive behaviour rather than relief from strong emotions</p><p>If you get accustomed to blowing off steam, you become dependent on it</p><p><strong>Conformity</strong></p><p>The mistaken belief that we are strong individuals who don't conform unless forced to. In reality, it takes little more than an authority figure or social pressure for us to conform</p><p>Never be afraid to question authority when your actions could cause harm</p><p><strong>Extinction Burst</strong></p><p>When your brain makes a last-ditch effort to return you to a bad habit after you quit it</p><p>To give up bad habits; overeating, smoking, or gambling, we must be prepared to look for alternative rewards or positive reinforcement, and we should expect resistance</p><p><strong>Embodied Cognition</strong></p><p>Our physical settings prime us to see the world a certain way. We translate our physical worlds into words, and then believe those words</p><p>We believe our opinions of people and events are objective, but they are often influenced by the environment around us</p><p><strong>Self-Handicapping</strong></p><p>Involves investments in a future reality in which you can blame your failure on something other than your ability</p><p>When the fear of failure is strong enough, we like to see new ways to blame possible failures on forces beyond our control to protect our egos</p><p><strong>Self-Fulfilling Prophecies</strong></p><p>A positive outlook will lead to positive predictions, and you will start to unconsciously manipulate your behaviour and actions to deliver those predictions</p><p>Things you think are true will become reality if given enough time to fester</p><p><strong>The Moment</strong></p><p>We believe we are one person, and our happiness is based on being content with our lives</p><p>In reality, we are multiple selves, and to be happy now and content later, we can't be focused only on reaching goals, because once we reach them, the experience ends</p><p><strong>Caveman Syndrome</strong></p><p>Humans are optimized for a world that existed 100,000 years ago, not for the world today</p><p>Food is everywhere; predators are not</p><p>We use to be in constant motion; now we sit behind desks at a computer</p><p>Anxiety from overstimulation is rampant</p><p>How to counteract? 👇</p><p><strong>Performance Requirements</strong></p><p>If you don’t give your body what it needs to run, you’ll won't function as well as you can</p><p>Basic tips:</p><ul><li>Exercise regularly</li><li>Get enough sunlight</li><li>Eat high-quality food</li><li>Get at least 7-8 hours of sleep</li><li>Avoid social media at the start of your day</li></ul><p><strong>The Onion Brain</strong></p><p>Our brains are made up of layers of internal voices that consistently change modes; excitement, concern, calmness</p><p>To be effective, we need to dissociate ourselves from the voices and realise that they are only an automatic reaction to our surrounding environment</p><p><strong>Perceptual Control</strong></p><p>We act to keep our perception of the world within acceptable boundaries</p><p>Once a certain action brings our perception under control, we stop acting until the system is once again out of control</p><p>Control is about adjusting to environmental changes as they happen</p><p><strong>Reference Level</strong></p><p>At the heart of every Perceptual Control system is a Reference Level-a range of perceptions that indicate the system is “under control”</p><p>When a perception is within the system’s reference level, nothing happens, when it isn't, change occurs</p><p><strong>Conservation of Energy</strong></p><p>Humans have evolved to avoid expending energy unless it's necessary</p><p>Unless a Reference Level is violated, we'll "conserve energy" by not acting</p><p>Can explain why people stay in marginally satisfying jobs for decades, it's "good enough" but not great</p><p><strong>Guiding Structure</strong></p><p>The structure of our environment is the largest determinant of our behavior</p><p>If you want to successfully change a behavior, change the structure that influences or supports the behavior first, and the behavior will follow—don't rely on willpower alone</p><p><strong>Reorganization</strong></p><p>Occurs when a Reference Level is violated, but you don’t know how to bring the system back under control</p><p>This is what happens when people feel “unhappy with their jobs”, or have the “quarter-life crisis”</p><p>There’s something wrong, but it’s hard to know what</p><p><strong>Conflict</strong></p><p>Occurs when two control systems try to change the same perception. This is what happens in the typical case of procrastination: one system wants to rest, and one wants to work</p><p>Conflicts can only be solved by changing Reference Levels: how success is defined</p><p><strong>That's it, thanks for reading!</strong></p><p>If you got value out of this, I’d appreciate you <a href=https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nZXRyZXZ1ZS5jby9wcm9maWxlL2FsZXhicm9nYW4_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPU1lbnRhbCUyME1vZGVscyUyQyUyMENvbmNlcHRzJTJDJTIwYW5kJTIwRnJhbWV3b3JrcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9UmV2dWUlMjBuZXdzbGV0dGVyIiwicG9zdF9pZCI6ImUwYjMwYzViLTA4MzctNDQzNi05NDRlLWEzYmI3MmY0NjZhMiIsInB1YmxpY2F0aW9uX2lkIjoiMTM3ZDVlODMtOTUwMy00ZGI3LWE4YzQtZjM0MTVjMjA1NWFlIiwidmlzaXRfdG9rZW4iOiIxMjA0ZWNlNy05ODhmLTRhY2QtYjc4MC0wMzZjMWNlZTEwNmIiLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzg3NDc2MDUuNzg0LCJpc3MiOiJvcmNoaWQifQ.KG-QZxvfFGJXjkDJiix2cDghWDYQSKc47ia54TgNUPc target=_blank>sharing it</a> or my <a href=https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3R3aXR0ZXIuY29tL19hbGV4YnJvZ2FuP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1NZW50YWwlMjBNb2RlbHMlMkMlMjBDb25jZXB0cyUyQyUyMGFuZCUyMEZyYW1ld29ya3MmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPVJldnVlJTIwbmV3c2xldHRlciIsInBvc3RfaWQiOiJlMGIzMGM1Yi0wODM3LTQ0MzYtOTQ0ZS1hM2JiNzJmNDY2YTIiLCJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbl9pZCI6IjEzN2Q1ZTgzLTk1MDMtNGRiNy1hOGM0LWYzNDE1YzIwNTVhZSIsInZpc2l0X3Rva2VuIjoiMTIwNGVjZTctOTg4Zi00YWNkLWI3ODAtMDM2YzFjZWUxMDZiIiwiaWF0IjoxNjc4NzQ3NjA1Ljc4NCwiaXNzIjoib3JjaGlkIn0.G36ROJQZ3vYv2UdwW3pp2Wcb0kbrVPgCQLw8mgeEHXw target=_blank>Twitter profile</a> on Twitter so others can get wiser too :)</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://alexbrogan.com/>Alex Brogan</a></span> ·
