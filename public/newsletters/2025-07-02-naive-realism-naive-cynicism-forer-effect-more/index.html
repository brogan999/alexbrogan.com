The more you know, the less confident you are\nBob confidently reassures his friends that there's no kelp in ice cream—they don't work in the dairy industry, after all\nAnchoring\nWe rely heavily on the first piece of information introduced when making decisions\nA price tag shows an original price of $1,000, now reduced to $700. You'll consider the item a bargain, regardless of its true worth\nAutomation Bias\nWe rely on automated systems, sometimes trusting too much in the automated correction of actually correct decisions\nYour phone auto-corrects \"There\" to \"Their\", so you assume it's right\nGoogle Effect (aka digital amnesia)\nWe tend to forget information that's easily looked up in search engines (facts: statistics, names, dates)\nPartly because the mind struggles to attach this type of knowledge to existing knowledge; partly because of information overload\nReactance Theory\nWe do the opposite of what we're told, especially when we perceive threats to personal freedoms or a limitation of our alternatives\nCan occur when someone is heavily pressured to accept a certain view, causing them to adopt an attitude contrary to that intended\nBackfire Effect\nWe believe that when our beliefs are challenged, we alter our opinions and incorporate new information into our thinking\nIn reality, when our deepest convictions are challenged by contradictory evidence, our beliefs get stronger\nThird Person Effect\nWe believe that others are more affected by mass media consumption than we ourselves are\n\"You've clearly been brainwashed by the media!”\nBelief Bias\nWe judge an argument’s strength not by how strongly it supports the conclusion but by how strongly we support the conclusion\nA useful thing to ask is 'when/how did I get this belief? We tend to automatically defend our ideas without ever really questioning them\nAvailability Cascade\nWhen a new concept enters the arena of ideas, people react to it, thereby amplifying it\nThe idea thus becomes more popular, causing even more people to amplify it by reacting to it until everyone feels the need to talk about it\nDeclinism\nYou remember the past as better than it was and expect the future to be worse than it will likely be\nInstead of relying on nostalgic impressions of how great things were, use measurable metrics such as life expectancy and prosperity statistics\nSunk Cost Fallacy\nYou irrationally cling to things that have already cost you something (investments, relationships, projects, etc.)\nTo escape, ask yourself: had I not already invested in this, would I do so today?\nGambler's Fallacy\nWe think future possibilities are affected by past events\nYou've lost 9 in a row, but you're sure to win the next one!\nYou've won 9 in a row, how could you possibly lose the next one?!1\nZero-Risk Bias\nWe tend to opt for situations where we can completely eliminate risk, seeking solace in the figure of 0%, over alternatives that may actually offer greater risk reduction\nExamples include insurance policies and 30-day money-back guarantees\nStereotyping\nWe adopt generalised beliefs that members of a group will be a certain way, despite not having any information about the individual\n\"He's got a fancy moustache, must be a hipster!”\nOutgroup Homogeneity Effect\nWe perceive out-group members as similar and our own in-groups as more diverse\nBob is not a gamer, but he thinks \"all gamers are the same.\"\nIn contrast, Bob plays sports, but he \"couldn't be more different to his teammates!”\nPlacebo Effect\nIf we believe a treatment will work, it often will have a small physiological effect\nBob was given a placebo to quell his pain, and his pain decreased1\nSurvivorship Bias\nWe tend to focus on those things that survived a process and overlook ones that failed\nYes, Entrepreneurship can lead to big wins. But, no, not everyone succeeds as the media demonstrates\nTachypsyhchia\nWhen our perception of time shifts depending on trauma, drug use, and physical exertion\n\"When the car almost hit me, time slowed down...”\nLaw of Triviality (aka bike-shedding)\nThe tendency to give disproportionate weight to trivial issues of a larger or more complex project\nIn other words, prioritising an issue that's easy to grasp and/or debate\nZeigarnik Effect\nThe tendency to remember unfinished or interrupted tasks better than completed ones\nWhen overwhelmed by your to-do list, stop to think of what you have already completed. It's far more motivating\nIKEA effect\nThe tendency to place higher value on things we partially created ourselves\n\"Don't you love this pot I spent $20 on? I painted it myself!”\nBen Franklin effect\nA person who has already performed a favour for another person is more likely to do another favour for the other than if they had received a favour from that person\nSimilar to commitment \u0026 consistency bias\nBystander effect\nA form of social loafing, it's the tendency for individuals to be less likely to offer help to a victim when other people are present\nIt arises because of a 'diffusion' of responsibility; clearly defined roles get clear outcomes\nSuggestibility\nThe tendency to accept and act on the suggestions of others\nYawning is an example of suggestibility because we are influenced by the behavior of others without conscious awareness\nFalse Memory\nThe tendency to mistake imagination for real memories\nBob is certain Linda said a really funny joke about bananas, when that joke actually came from a TV show\nCryptomnesia\nWhen a forgotten memory returns without being recognized as such. We believe it is something new and original\nExperiencing a memory as if it were a new inspiration\nClustering Illusion\nThe tendency to find patterns and \"clusters\" in random data\nIn other words, it is our natural inclination to create order from chaos; even when chaos is what exists\nPessimism Bias\nThe tendency to overestimate the likelihood of negative outcomes\nEvolutionary speaking this developed as a defence mechanism and served humans well\nIt made sense to hear a noise in the bushes and run the other way\nHowever, as @Naval would say, in the modern world it doesn't make sense to be a pessimist\nWe've never lived in a safer, more comfortable world\nPerhaps the worst aspect of pessimism is that even if something good happens, you'll probably feel pessimistic about it anyway11\nOptimism Bias\nOn the other side of the coin, this is having too much faith in a good outcome or not paying enough attention to the potential for a bad outcome\nOptimism motivates us to pursue our goals but must be balanced with pragmatism\nBlindspot Bias\nThe tendency to think we're immune from bias but those around us aren't\n\"That argument is biased!\"\nOccurs regularly in shouting matches\nPublication Bias\nOccurs when the outcome of an experiment or research study influences the decision whether to publish it\nStudies with significant results can be of the same standard as studies with a null result with respect to the quality of execution and design\nBut, statistically significant results are 3x more likely to be published than papers with null results\nThis can unduly motivate researchers to manipulate their research practices to ensure that a statistically significant result is reported\nNegativity Bias\nAllowing negative things to disproportionately influence your thinking\nPro-and-con lists or thinking in terms of probabilities can help you evaluate things more objectively and avoid this bias\nWhat you see is all there is (WYSIATI)\nThe tendency to make judgements and impressions according to the information we have available\nIn general, we don't spend enough time thinking \"well, there are still many things I don't know\"\nSimply, we assert what we do know\nThe clearest example of this is when we meet someone, we take less than a few seconds to build an impression\nImmediately, we decide whether they are kind and nice or dominant and hostile, and whether we will like them or not\nThis is all done on incomplete information\nThe Associative Machine\nThe tendency for our brain to form links between ideas/actions/events in associative memory and develop coherent accounts of these linkages\nRelated to the priming effect, this helps explain the pattern of System 1 Thinking (See @kahneman_daniel)\nJealousy (Envy) Tendency\nWhen you think of how natural the differences among us are, you quickly come to realize the potential power and frequency that bias from envy and jealousy can have on world affairs\n“It is not greed that drives the world, but envy.” Warren Buffett\nPreferential Attachment\nA bias whereby some quantity, typically a form of wealth or another reward, is distributed among a number of individuals or objects according to how much they already have so that those who are already wealthy receive more than those who are not1\nClassical conditioning\nThe tendency to feel emotion towards intangible objects, with the emotion coming from past associations rather than direct effects\nFor example, the first time you eat a food you get food poisoning, it'll be hard for you to ever eat it again\nDenial\nThe tendency to discount or disbelieve an important and uncomfortable fact\nWhen you're in denial, ask yourself, \"Will denying the facts be more or less painful in the long run? And how would I feel if I faced, and heartily embraced, the truth?”\nNarrative Fallacy\nThe tendency to interpret sequences of facts as a story by threading them together into an imagined chain of cause \u0026 effect\nIf an alcoholic loses their job we assume the alcoholism led to it, even if it didn’t\nCuriosity Instinct\nWe like to call other species curious, but we are the most curious of all\nWithout the human curiosity instinct, science and technology would not be present\nEven before there were direct incentives to innovate (capitalism), humans innovated out of curiosity\nLanguage Instinct\nHumans are born with an innate capacity for language\nLanguage is an ability unique to humans, produced by evolution to solve the specific problem of communication among social hunter-gatherers\nGood communication is a superpower\nFirst-conclusion bias\nA tendency to settle on the first information or conclusion adopted for a given problem, thus remaining resistant to the search for any more alternatives or asking further questions\nCan be countered with simple useful mental routines (objective reasoning)\nRelative satisfaction/misery tendencies\nThe tendency to determine one’s own level of satisfaction by comparing circumstances to others’ circumstances\nThese relative tendencies cause us great misery or happiness in a very wide variety of objectively different situations\nHyperbolic Discounting\nThe tendency to show a preference for immediate rather than delayed rewards\nHumans discount future events. This is why it's easy to succumb to bad habits\nBad habits have an immediate payoff while the benefits of good habits can take years to see\nIllusion of control\nThe tendency for people to overestimate their ability to control events\nThis leads us to overestimate our odds of succeeding or getting a positive outcome and to invent explanations linking our behavior to some result\nLoss aversion\nThe tendency to prefer avoiding losses compared to acquiring equivalent gains\nThis overwhelming fear of loss can you to behave irrationally and make bad decisions, such as holding onto a stock for too long or too little time\nMaslow's Heirarchy of needs\nThe motivational theory created by psychologist Abraham Maslow stating that humans have five categories of needs in order: physiological, safety, love, esteem, and self-actualization\nAt the bottom of the pyramid are the physiological (or basic) human needs that are required for survival: food, shelter, water, sleep, etc.\nIf these requirements are not met, the body cannot continue to function\nOnce physical needs are satisfied, security (aka individual safety) takes precedence\nSecurity and safety needs include personal security, financial security, and health and well-being\nThese first two levels are critical to our physical survival\nOnce we have basic nutrition, shelter, and safety, we seek to fulfill higher-level needs\nThe third level of need is social, which include love and belonging; the need to share and connect with others\nDeficiencies at this level can impact our ability to form and maintain emotionally significant relationships\nWe (humans) need to feel a sense of belonging and acceptance\nWithout this feeling, it's easy to succumb to psychological difficulties such as loneliness or depression\nThe fourth level is esteem, which represents our innate desire to be valued and validated by others (through recognition or success)\nThis level also includes self-esteem, which refers to the regard and acceptance we have four ourselves\nImbalances at this level can result in low self-esteem or an inferiority complex\nWhen we suffer from low self-esteem we may find that external validation by others—through fame, glory, accolades, etc.—only partially or temporarily fulfills needs at this level\nThe fifth level of the pyramid is self-actualization\nHere we feel that we've reached our full potential and are doing everything we're capable of\nSelf-actualization is rarely a permanent feeling or state\nRather, it refers to the ongoing need for personal growth and discovery that we have throughout their lives\nSelf-actualization may occur after reaching an important goal or overcoming a particular challenge, and it may be marked by a new sense of self-confidence or contentment\nSo, what does this tell us? Higher needs in the hierarchy emerge when the previous need is appropriately satisfied\nWe must endeavour to meet our lower level needs—what I like to call the foundation—before we can become the best version of ourselves\nOperant Conditioning\nThe tendency to make associations between a behaviour and consequence (whether negative or positive) for that behaviour\nHelps inform the optimal approach to learning in a given environment (e.g., the carrot or the stick approach)1\nTribalism\nA way of thinking in which people are overly loyal to their own social group, at times disregarding logic and devaluing kindness or justice\nVaccination vs. Anti-Vaccination. BTC vs. ETH.\nTribalism can lead to bigotry and racism and, when taken to extremes, even war\nAlternative Histories\nAlternative histories are all the outcomes that could have happened, but did not\nThey are invisible, so we contemplate them very rarely\nHowever, for better thinking, we should always consider what they are and aim to separate process from outcome\nIncentive-Caused Bias\nPeople with a vested interest in something will tend to guide you in the direction of their interest\n\"Show me the incentives and I'll show you the outcome\"—Charlie Munger\nAs the saying goes: don’t ask the barber if you need a haircut\nVariable Reinforcement\nThe tendency for behaviour to be reinforced more strongly when a reward is irregular or unpredictable frequency\nGambling. Social media notifications. FIFA packs. NFT Investing. The list goes on\nBe aware of what's influencing you\n7 Deadly Sins / 7 Heavenly Virtues\nDeveloped by the Roman Catholic Church and influenced by profound thinkers such as Aristotle\nThese Sins \u0026 Virtues have remained largely untouched over centuries and provide effective guideposts for character development\nUnsurprisingly, the idea is simply to have more of the virtues and less of the sins\nHere are the 7 virtues:\nChastity: Courage and boldness\nAbstinence: Self-control and moderation\nLiberality: Generosity\nDiligence: A zealous and careful nature in one's actions and work\nPatience: Forbearance and endurance through moderation. Resolving conflicts peacefully and the ability to forgive\nKindness: Charity, compassion, friendship, and sympathy without prejudice and for its own sake\nHumility: Modest behavior, selflessness, and the giving of respect\nand the sins:\nLust: An insatiable need for sex or things of a sexual nature\nGluttony: Over indulgences of anything to the extreme, usually food or drink\nGreed: The need for material possessions or material wealth\nSloth: Sadness, depression, or the inability to feel joy\nWrath: Extreme anger, rage, hatred, or a need for vengeance or revenge\nEnvy: The need to have better or be better than others. Wanting what others have for yourself\nPride: A need for public acceptance in all acts or a need to be more important than others\nSelf-Interest (aka \"What's in it for me\")\nThe tendency for the brain to subconsciously decide that what's good for it is good for everyone else\nThose who preference the best outcome rather than being right are people you want to work with\nSquelch By Denial\nRelated to self-interest. The tendency to silence anything that interferes with our own personal success or income\nAgain, strive to work with people who want the optimal outcome for most, not just them\nFoot in the Door Technique\nA compliance tactic that assumes agreeing to a small request increases the likelihood of agreeing to a second, larger request\nExample: Offering to work for free as a means of securing a full-time job at the firm you'd like to work at\nMost Respectful Interpretation\nAssuming the best of others. Considering only the best, kindest, most helpful interpretation of every communication and responding solely to that version\nInvolves resisting jumping to negative conclusions and preferencing generous ones\nBright spots\nA bright spot is a positive sign in a sea of negative ones\nAsking if there are bright spots can help inform whether it's worth persevering with a particular endeavour\nE.g, in business, a bright spot may be a small subset of customers who love what you're doing\nIn your career, it may be the things you love about your job\nAsking whether there are enough bright spots to warrant persisting is a good strategy\nIf you can’t find any bright spots in what you’re doing after some time, critically evaluate your position and consider a pivot\nBurnout\nWhere continued high stress takes its toll and eventually extinguishes your motivation, sometimes requiring a complete reset\nLife is a marathon, you'll achieve more over your career by being consistently productive and compounding success\nAt times, it makes sense to sprint and then rest, but for most people, it's important to find a level of productivity that can be sustained over the course of a career\nAntidote: Listen closely to your body and mind\nSee Four Thousand Weeks by @oliverburkeman for more on this\nDecision Fatigue\nMaking decisions is exhausting. Anyone who has ever researched a long trip—flight, hotels, activities, restaurants, weather—knows this well\nAfter all the comparing, considering, and choosing, you are exhausted. Science calls this decision fatigue\nDecision fatigue is dangerous: As a consumer, you become more susceptible to advertising messages and impulse buys\nAs a decision maker, you are more prone to seduction or persuasion\nWillpower is like a battery. After a while it runs out and needs to be recharged\nHow do you do this? By taking a break, relaxing, and eating something\nWhat does it tell us? Save your important decisions for the morning and minimise the number of menial decisions you make each day (remember why Steve jobs wore the same clothes every day...?)\nDefault Effect (Status)\nPeople crave what they know. Given the choice of trying something new or sticking to the tried-and-tested option, we tend to be highly conservative, even if a change would be beneficial\nWhere does it come from? Sheer convenience and loss aversion\nGateway drug theory\nThe tendency for a drug to lead to an increased probability of the use of further dangerous substances\nProponents suggest that the adverse effects of these substances are minimal, but they should be avoided because they lead to more harmful drug use\nGolem Effect\nRelated to the observer effect, the tendency for performance to decline when supervisors, teachers, or bosses have low expectations of one’s abilities\nThe golem effect is a type of self-fulfilling prophecy\nIntuition\nYou make most of your everyday decisions using your intuition, with your subconscious automatically intuiting what to do from encoded knowledge\nIt’s your sixth sense, your gut feeling, drawing on your past experiences and natural programming to react to circumstances\nYou can run into trouble when you blindly trust your gut in situations where it is unclear whether you should be thinking more deliberately\nFollowing your intuition alone can cause you to fall prey to many biases, such as anchoring or the availability bias\nYou probably don't have the right experience intuitively to handle everything that life throws at you, and so you should be especially wary of your intuition in any new or unfamiliar situation\nIn these situations, slow down and bring objective decision-making to the table\nLearned helplessness\nThe tendency to stop trying to escape difficult situations because we have gotten used to these conditions over time\nSomeone learns that they are helpless to control their circumstances, so they give up trying to change them\nLearned helplessness can be overcome when we see that our actions make a difference, that we aren’t actually helpless\nIf feeling helpless, focus on the small wins and progression, or seek feedback from someone who can lift you up\nNon-response bias\nOccurs when a subset of people don't participate in an experiment after they're selected for it (they fail to respond to the survey)\nIf the reason for not responding is related to the topic of the survey, the results will end up biased\nFor example, your company wants to understand whether it has a problem with employee motivation\nYou choose to study it via an engagement survey\nEmployees missing the survey due to vacation would be random and not likely to introduce bias\nHowever, employees not responding due to apathy would be nonrandom and would likely bias the results\nThat's because the latter group is made up of disengaged employees, and by not participating, their disengagement is not being captured\nObserver Expectancy Bias\nWhere the cognitive biases of researchers, or observers, may cause them to influence the outcome in the direction they expected\nOptimistic Probability Bias\nSometimes you may want something to be true so badly that you fool yourself into thinking it is likely to be true—this is known as optimistic probability bias\nThe closer you are to the facts, the easier it is to avoid this bias\nParanoia\nThe tendency to believe that others are trying to harm, deceive or exploit you\nSome level of paranoia is helpful but too much will shut you off from the world—it's good to be sceptical, but not too sceptical\nPresent Bias\nThe tendency to overvalue near-term rewards over making incremental progress on long-term goals\nThis explains a lot of procrastination. It's easy to find reasons to opt-out of positive habits on a given day, but too often and you'll never reach your goals\nSelf-Selection Bias\nArises when individuals select themselves into a group, causing a biased sample with a nonprobability sampling\nMarketers can stumble into the trap in this way: To analyze how much customers value their newsletter, they send out a questionnaire\nUnfortunately, this reaches only one group: current subscribers who are clearly satisfied, have time to respond and have not cancelled their subscriptions\nThe others make up no part of the sample. Result: The survey is worthless\nSocial versus Market Norms\nYoung professionals would be unlikely to take up babysitting for extra cash, but likely to babysit for free when a friend is in need\nThe first scenario is framed from a market perspective: \"Would you babysit my kids for $30/hour?\"\nThe second is framed from a social perspective: \"Can you please do me a favour?\"\nThe difference in this situation can be thought of as social versus market norms and draws on the concept of reciprocity\nWe must be careful not to inadvertently replace social norms with market norms, because it can end up eliminating benefits that are hard to bring back\nOnce social norms are undermined, the damage has been done and they are no longer norms\nTake pause when thinking about introducing monetary incentives into a situation where social norms are the standard\nSocial Norms: No money involved, no instant payback, community situations\nMarket Norms: Money involved, transactional, business situations\nUltimatum Game\nAn experimental economics game in which two parties interact anonymously and only once without reciprocation\nThe first player proposes how to divide a sum of money (Say, $10) with the second. If the second player rejects this division, neither gets anything\nIf the second accepts, the first gets their demand and the second gets the rest\nThe most logical way to play is for the first person to offer the minimum (e.g., $9.99/$0.01 split) and for the second to accept it since otherwise, they would get nothing\nIn practice, though, across most scenarios and cultures, the second person usually rejects offers lower than 30% of the total, because the perceived unfairness of the offer\nThey would rather deny the first person anything, even at the expense of nothing for themselves\nIt's critical to keep this strong desire for fairness in mind when you make decisions that impact people important to you, such as those in your family (chore distributions, wills, etc.) or your company (compensation, promotions, etc.)\nVictim-Blaming\nWhere people (\"Victims\") are blamed for their circumstances, with no accounting for factors of randomness like the birth lottery or bad luck\nProblematic approach because it's a broad judgement that's often inaccurate at the individual level\nInconsistency - Avoidance Tendency\nWe like to be consistent in everything we do, say, and everything we are\nTo save energy, we are often reluctant to change our habits, especially bad ones\nThese patterns lead to cognitive errors, limiting our choice of actions in life\nExcessive Self-Regard Tendency\nThe natural tendency to overestimate your own abilities\nA healthy amount of humility can keep you from assuming you know everything\nIt helps to cultivate relationships with people who aren’t afraid to tell you when you’re wrong\nUse-it-or-lose-it Tendency\nAll skills attenuate with disuse. Wise people engage in regular practice for their useful skills\nWhen a skill is raised to fluency, the skill (1) will be lost more slowly and (2) will come back faster when refreshed with new learning\nDrug Misinfluence Tendency\nDrug addicted people tend to believe that they remain in respectable condition, with respectable prospects\nThey thus display an extremely unrealistic denial of reality as they go deeper and deeper into deterioration…\nOne should stay far away from any conduct at all likely to drift into drug/chemical dependency\nEven a small chance of suffering so great a damage should be avoided\nSenescence-Misinfluence Tendency\nAs we get older, our mental abilities decline. It’s going to happen to all of us —there's no stopping it\nIt may be possible to slow the decline by continuing to think and learn as you age, so make a commitment to yourself to never stop learning\nTwaddle Tendency\nHumans waste a lot of time talking about nothing at all\nOr by flicking through Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, and suddenly realizing an hour has passed\nValue your time, and stay far away from time-wasters if you need to get serious work done\nReason-Respecting Tendency\nThe tendency of humans to treasure the importance of reasons\nReasons help to learn, so a teacher provides reasons for teaching certain knowledge rather than laying out the desired belief ex-cathedra with no reasons given\nUnfortunately, this tendency is so strong that even providing meaningless or incorrect reasons will increase compliance with directions or requests\nIt's a conditioned reflex, based on a widespread appreciation for reasons\nThis has been demonstrated in psychology experiments where participants successfully jump to the head of lines in front of copying machines by explaining their reason: \"I have to make some copies.\"\nWhen requesting something, add on \"because\" and watch compliance go up\nFew practices are wiser than not only thinking through reasons before giving directions but also communicating these reasons to the recipient\nIt also applies in group decision making: regardless of logic, sometimes having more reasons wins\nRashomon Effect\nThe situation where an event is given contradictory explanations by the individuals involved\nIt's a storytelling method in cinema meant to provide different perspectives and points of view of the same incident\nIt reflects witnesses subjective interpretation and self-interested advocacy, rather than an objective truth\nThe Rashomon effect is evident when the event is the outcome of litigation. One should not be surprised when both parties claim to have won the case\nParadox of Knowledge\nThe more you know, the less you can clearly explain\nOur inability to explain familiar concepts is a form of cognitive bias wherein experts often overestimate the ability of novices\nHot Hand Fallacy\nOur tendency to believe that a successful streak is likely to lead to further success\nExample: A basketball player made 3 consecutive shots, we may believe they have a greater chance of making the 4th than is actually likely\nAlso applies to gambling/investing\nThe Turkey Illusion\nA metaphor for the one who is both surprised and harmed by black swan events, i.e., unpredictable events of massive consequences\n\"It's never happened in the past, it's unlikely to happen in the future.\"\nIt represents a confusion between risk and uncertainty\nThis confusion between risk and uncertainty has baffled investors for centuries\nIn a casino, the probabilities of different outcomes are calculable and hence the risk can be controlled\nThere’s no unknown-unknown in the sterile environment of a casino\nBut, in the real world of business, not only the probabilities of possible outcomes are unknown, but the range of possible outcomes are also unknown\n\"Predicting the rain doesn’t count (uncertainty), building an ark does (risk mitigation).\" - Warren Buffett\nLucretius problem\nA mental defect where we assume the worst-case event that has happened is the worst-case event that can ever happen in the future\nWe fail to understand that the worst event that has happened in the past surpassed the worst event that came before it\nThe Echo Chamber Effect\nWe tend to be surrounded by people who are like us and share our worldview\nSocial media accentuates this by tailoring our news and opinion feeds to match our pre-set views\nThis effect feeds on another fundamental cognitive error called confirmation bias\nTo avoid falling into this homogeneity trap, we need to seek out and dispassionately engage with people whose views differ from our own\nThis applies not just to political views, but also investments, or life philosophies\nLucifer Effect\nHuman beings underestimate their own vulnerabilities which can turn them into evil\nDemonstrated through the Stanford Prison Experiment where participants were assigned roles of 'prisoners' and 'guards'\nTests showed all students had no psychological issues\nA few days into the experiment, participants who were playing guards began to treat the prisoners as if they were non-humans\nThe prisoners began to experience extreme stress and the more they acted like non-humans, the more the guards mistreated them\nThe experiment was supposed to last for two weeks but had to be abruptly ended after 5 days\nOften when we are in a role, we tend to act as others expect\nAs a consequence, good people, under certain circumstances, can turn into bad (dishonest, evil, and even dangerous) people\nPareidolia Effect\nThe tendency for our perception to impose a meaningful interpretation on a nebulous stimulus, usually visual, so that one sees an object, pattern, or meaning where there is none\nExamples are perceived images of animals, faces, or objects in cloud formations\nDenominator Blindness\nThe failure to put big numbers into proper context. Put simply, information that provides only a numerator is of limited use\nHeadlines or statistics that provide only a numerator are of limited use, they need to be considered in full context or relatively\nDenominator Blindness The failure to put big numbers into proper context. Put simply, information that provides only a numerator is of limited use Headlines or statistics that provide only a numerator are of limited use, they need to be considered in full context or relatively\nLudic Fallacy\nThe tendency for people to mistake the kind of uncertainty found in games to the kind of uncertainty found in real life\nThe attributes of the uncertainty we face in real life have little connection to the sterilized ones we encounter in games\nScarcity Bias\nWe unconsciously assume things that are scarce are valuable and things that are abundant are not\nFrequently occurs when we are told that a product is in short supply and we might miss a great deal unless we book/pay now\nHawthorne Effect\nOccurs when people behave differently because they know they are being watched\nIt can affect all sorts of behaviours such as dietary habits, or hygiene practices because these have considerable opportunity for instantaneous modification\nThe Hawthorne effect can also lead to the observation being the intervention\nFor example, a study of hand-washing among medical staff found that when the staff knew they were being watched, compliance with hand-washing was 55% greater than when they were not being watched\nInattentional Blindess\nWhen focused on a task that demands attention, a failure to notice a fully visible, but unexpected object or event which occurs in full view\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo\nHas implications for driving, the reliability of witness statements, and pick-pocketers\nPreference Falsification\nPeople lie about their true opinions and conform to socially acceptable preferences instead\nIn private they’ll say one thing. In public, they’ll say another. Often occurs because they believe the conveyed preference is more acceptable socially\nReductive Bias\nThe need to treat non-linear complex systems as if they are linear\nMistakes generally arise from the mismatch between the complex reality we face and the simplifying mental routines we use to cope with that complexity\nBizarreness Effect\nBizarre or controversial information is easier to recall than what is common\nCaused by the human interest in information that is novel, strange, or unusual and the tendency for memories to fade more for mundane information\nThere are interesting implications for memory enhancement such as the SEE principle\nThe principle relies on using all five Senses, Exaggeration (bizarreness), and Energising (animation) to help remember otherwise mundane information\nThat's it, thanks for reading!If you got value out of this, I’d appreciate you sharing it or my Twitter profile on Twitter so others can get wiser too :)\nPlease send me a reply if you have feedback on either of the following questions:\nWas the level of explanation sufficient to understand the concept?Would you like to see each week ‘themed’ by topic, or would you prefer a mix of fields each week?‍\n","wordCount":"5890","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-07-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-07-02T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://alexbrogan.com/newsletters/2025-07-02-naive-realism-naive-cynicism-forer-effect-more/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Alex Brogan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://alexbrogan.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://alexbrogan.com/ accesskey=h title="Alex Brogan (Alt + H)">Alex Brogan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

This is why it's easy to succumb to bad habits</p><p>Bad habits have an immediate payoff while the benefits of good habits can take years to see</p><p><strong>Illusion of control</strong></p><p>The tendency for people to overestimate their ability to control events</p><p>This leads us to overestimate our odds of succeeding or getting a positive outcome and to invent explanations linking our behavior to some result</p><p><strong>Loss aversion</strong></p><p>The tendency to prefer avoiding losses compared to acquiring equivalent gains</p><p>This overwhelming fear of loss can you to behave irrationally and make bad decisions, such as holding onto a stock for too long or too little time</p><p><strong>Maslow's Heirarchy of needs</strong></p><p>The motivational theory created by psychologist Abraham Maslow stating that humans have five categories of needs in order: physiological, safety, love, esteem, and self-actualization</p><p>At the bottom of the pyramid are the physiological (or basic) human needs that are required for survival: food, shelter, water, sleep, etc.</p><p>If these requirements are not met, the body cannot continue to function</p><p>Once physical needs are satisfied, security (aka individual safety) takes precedence</p><p>Security and safety needs include personal security, financial security, and health and well-being</p><p>These first two levels are critical to our physical survival</p><p>Once we have basic nutrition, shelter, and safety, we seek to fulfill higher-level needs</p><p>The third level of need is social, which include love and belonging; the need to share and connect with others</p><p>Deficiencies at this level can impact our ability to form and maintain emotionally significant relationships</p><p>We (humans) need to feel a sense of belonging and acceptance</p><p>Without this feeling, it's easy to succumb to psychological difficulties such as loneliness or depression</p><p>The fourth level is esteem, which represents our innate desire to be valued and validated by others (through recognition or success)</p><p>This level also includes self-esteem, which refers to the regard and acceptance we have four ourselves</p><p>Imbalances at this level can result in low self-esteem or an inferiority complex</p><p>When we suffer from low self-esteem we may find that external validation by others—through fame, glory, accolades, etc.—only partially or temporarily fulfills needs at this level</p><p>The fifth level of the pyramid is self-actualization</p><p>Here we feel that we've reached our full potential and are doing everything we're capable of</p><p>Self-actualization is rarely a permanent feeling or state</p><p>Rather, it refers to the ongoing need for personal growth and discovery that we have throughout their lives</p><p>Self-actualization may occur after reaching an important goal or overcoming a particular challenge, and it may be marked by a new sense of self-confidence or contentment</p><p>So, what does this tell us? Higher needs in the hierarchy emerge when the previous need is appropriately satisfied</p><p>We must endeavour to meet our lower level needs—what I like to call the foundation—before we can become the best version of ourselves</p><p><strong>Operant Conditioning</strong></p><p>The tendency to make associations between a behaviour and consequence (whether negative or positive) for that behaviour</p><p>Helps inform the optimal approach to learning in a given environment (e.g., the carrot or the stick approach)1</p><p><strong>Tribalism</strong></p><p>A way of thinking in which people are overly loyal to their own social group, at times disregarding logic and devaluing kindness or justice</p><p>Vaccination vs. Anti-Vaccination. BTC vs. ETH.</p><p>Tribalism can lead to bigotry and racism and, when taken to extremes, even war</p><p><strong>Alternative Histories</strong></p><p>Alternative histories are all the outcomes that could have happened, but did not</p><p>They are invisible, so we contemplate them very rarely</p><p>However, for better thinking, we should always consider what they are and aim to separate process from outcome</p><p><strong>Incentive-Caused Bias</strong></p><p>People with a vested interest in something will tend to guide you in the direction of their interest</p><p>"Show me the incentives and I'll show you the outcome"—Charlie Munger</p><p>As the saying goes: don’t ask the barber if you need a haircut</p><p><strong>Variable Reinforcement</strong></p><p>The tendency for behaviour to be reinforced more strongly when a reward is irregular or unpredictable frequency</p><p>Gambling.

Resolving conflicts peacefully and the ability to forgive</p><p>Kindness: Charity, compassion, friendship, and sympathy without prejudice and for its own sake</p><p>Humility: Modest behavior, selflessness, and the giving of respect</p><p><em>and the sins:</em></p><p>Lust: An insatiable need for sex or things of a sexual nature</p><p>Gluttony: Over indulgences of anything to the extreme, usually food or drink</p><p>Greed: The need for material possessions or material wealth</p><p>Sloth: Sadness, depression, or the inability to feel joy</p><p>Wrath: Extreme anger, rage, hatred, or a need for vengeance or revenge</p><p>Envy: The need to have better or be better than others. Wanting what others have for yourself</p><p>Pride: A need for public acceptance in all acts or a need to be more important than others</p><p><strong>Self-Interest (aka "What's in it for me")</strong></p><p>The tendency for the brain to subconsciously decide that what's good for it is good for everyone else</p><p>Those who preference the best outcome rather than being right are people you want to work with</p><p><strong>Squelch By Denial</strong></p><p>Related to self-interest. The tendency to silence anything that interferes with our own personal success or income</p><p>Again, strive to work with people who want the optimal outcome for most, not just them</p><p><strong>Foot in the Door Technique</strong></p><p>A compliance tactic that assumes agreeing to a small request increases the likelihood of agreeing to a second, larger request</p><p>Example: Offering to work for free as a means of securing a full-time job at the firm you'd like to work at</p><p><strong>Most Respectful Interpretation</strong></p><p>Assuming the best of others. Considering only the best, kindest, most helpful interpretation of every communication and responding solely to that version</p><p>Involves resisting jumping to negative conclusions and preferencing generous ones</p><p><strong>Bright spots</strong></p><p>A bright spot is a positive sign in a sea of negative ones</p><p>Asking if there are bright spots can help inform whether it's worth persevering with a particular endeavour</p><p>E.g, in business, a bright spot may be a small subset of customers who love what you're doing</p><p>In your career, it may be the things you love about your job</p><p>Asking whether there are enough bright spots to warrant persisting is a good strategy</p><p>If you can’t find any bright spots in what you’re doing after some time, critically evaluate your position and consider a pivot</p><p><strong>Burnout</strong></p><p>Where continued high stress takes its toll and eventually extinguishes your motivation, sometimes requiring a complete reset</p><p>Life is a marathon, you'll achieve more over your career by being consistently productive and compounding success</p><p>At times, it makes sense to sprint and then rest, but for most people, it's important to find a level of productivity that can be sustained over the course of a career</p><p>Antidote: Listen closely to your body and mind</p><p>See Four Thousand Weeks by @oliverburkeman for more on this</p><p><strong>Decision Fatigue</strong></p><p>Making decisions is exhausting. Anyone who has ever researched a long trip—flight, hotels, activities, restaurants, weather—knows this well</p><p>After all the comparing, considering, and choosing, you are exhausted. Science calls this decision fatigue</p><p>Decision fatigue is dangerous: As a consumer, you become more susceptible to advertising messages and impulse buys</p><p>As a decision maker, you are more prone to seduction or persuasion</p><p>Willpower is like a battery. After a while it runs out and needs to be recharged</p><p>How do you do this? By taking a break, relaxing, and eating something</p><p>What does it tell us? Save your important decisions for the morning and minimise the number of menial decisions you make each day (remember why Steve jobs wore the same clothes every day...?)</p><p><strong>Default Effect (Status)</strong></p><p>People crave what they know. Given the choice of trying something new or sticking to the tried-and-tested option, we tend to be highly conservative, even if a change would be beneficial</p><p>Where does it come from? Sheer convenience and loss aversion</p><p><strong>Gateway drug theory</strong></p><p>The tendency for a drug to lead to an increased probability of the use of further dangerous substances</p><p>Proponents suggest that the adverse effects of these substances are minimal, but they should be avoided because they lead to more harmful drug use</p><p><strong>Golem Effect</strong></p><p>Related to the observer effect, the tendency for performance to decline when supervisors, teachers, or bosses have low expectations of one’s abilities</p><p>The golem effect is a type of self-fulfilling prophecy</p><p><strong>Intuition</strong></p><p>You make most of your everyday decisions using your intuition, with your subconscious automatically intuiting what to do from encoded knowledge</p><p>It’s your sixth sense, your gut feeling, drawing on your past experiences and natural programming to react to circumstances</p><p>You can run into trouble when you blindly trust your gut in situations where it is unclear whether you should be thinking more deliberately</p><p>Following your intuition alone can cause you to fall prey to many biases, such as anchoring or the availability bias</p><p>You probably don't have the right experience intuitively to handle everything that life throws at you, and so you should be especially wary of your intuition in any new or unfamiliar situation</p><p>In these situations, slow down and bring objective decision-making to the table</p><p><strong>Learned helplessness</strong></p><p>The tendency to stop trying to escape difficult situations because we have gotten used to these conditions over time</p><p>Someone learns that they are helpless to control their circumstances, so they give up trying to change them</p><p>Learned helplessness can be overcome when we see that our actions make a difference, that we aren’t actually helpless</p><p>If feeling helpless, focus on the small wins and progression, or seek feedback from someone who can lift you up</p><p><strong>Non-response bias</strong></p><p>Occurs when a subset of people don't participate in an experiment after they're selected for it (they fail to respond to the survey)</p><p>If the reason for not responding is related to the topic of the survey, the results will end up biased</p><p>For example, your company wants to understand whether it has a problem with employee motivation</p><p>You choose to study it via an engagement survey</p><p>Employees missing the survey due to vacation would be random and not likely to introduce bias</p><p>However, employees not responding due to apathy would be nonrandom and would likely bias the results</p><p>That's because the latter group is made up of disengaged employees, and by not participating, their disengagement is not being captured</p><p><strong>Observer Expectancy Bias</strong></p><p>Where the cognitive biases of researchers, or observers, may cause them to influence the outcome in the direction they expected</p><p><strong>Optimistic Probability Bias</strong></p><p>Sometimes you may want something to be true so badly that you fool yourself into thinking it is likely to be true—this is known as optimistic probability bias</p><p>The closer you are to the facts, the easier it is to avoid this bias</p><p><strong>Paranoia</strong></p><p>The tendency to believe that others are trying to harm, deceive or exploit you</p><p>Some level of paranoia is helpful but too much will shut you off from the world—it's good to be sceptical, but not too sceptical</p><p><strong>Present Bias</strong></p><p>The tendency to overvalue near-term rewards over making incremental progress on long-term goals</p><p>This explains a lot of procrastination. It's easy to find reasons to opt-out of positive habits on a given day, but too often and you'll never reach your goals</p><p><strong>Self-Selection Bias</strong></p><p>Arises when individuals select themselves into a group, causing a biased sample with a nonprobability sampling</p><p>Marketers can stumble into the trap in this way: To analyze how much customers value their newsletter, they send out a questionnaire</p><p>Unfortunately, this reaches only one group: current subscribers who are clearly satisfied, have time to respond and have not cancelled their subscriptions</p><p>The others make up no part of the sample. Result: The survey is worthless</p><p><strong>Social versus Market Norms</strong></p><p>Young professionals would be unlikely to take up babysitting for extra cash, but likely to babysit for free when a friend is in need</p><p>The first scenario is framed from a market perspective: "Would you babysit my kids for $30/hour?"</p><p>The second is framed from a social perspective: "Can you please do me a favour?"</p><p>The difference in this situation can be thought of as social versus market norms and draws on the concept of reciprocity</p><p>We must be careful not to inadvertently replace social norms with market norms, because it can end up eliminating benefits that are hard to bring back</p><p>Once social norms are undermined, the damage has been done and they are no longer norms</p><p>Take pause when thinking about introducing monetary incentives into a situation where social norms are the standard</p><p>Social Norms: No money involved, no instant payback, community situations</p><p>Market Norms: Money involved, transactional, business situations</p><p><strong>Ultimatum Game</strong></p><p>An experimental economics game in which two parties interact anonymously and only once without reciprocation</p><p>The first player proposes how to divide a sum of money (Say, $10) with the second. If the second player rejects this division, neither gets anything</p><p>If the second accepts, the first gets their demand and the second gets the rest</p><p>The most logical way to play is for the first person to offer the minimum (e.g., $9.99/$0.01 split) and for the second to accept it since otherwise, they would get nothing</p><p>In practice, though, across most scenarios and cultures, the second person usually rejects offers lower than 30% of the total, because the perceived unfairness of the offer</p><p>They would rather deny the first person anything, even at the expense of nothing for themselves</p><p>It's critical to keep this strong desire for fairness in mind when you make decisions that impact people important to you, such as those in your family (chore distributions, wills, etc.) or your company (compensation, promotions, etc.)</p><p><strong>Victim-Blaming</strong></p><p>Where people ("Victims") are blamed for their circumstances, with no accounting for factors of randomness like the birth lottery or bad luck</p><p>Problematic approach because it's a broad judgement that's often inaccurate at the individual level</p><p><strong>Inconsistency - Avoidance Tendency</strong></p><p>We like to be consistent in everything we do, say, and everything we are</p><p>To save energy, we are often reluctant to change our habits, especially bad ones</p><p>These patterns lead to cognitive errors, limiting our choice of actions in life</p><p><strong>Excessive Self-Regard Tendency</strong></p><p>The natural tendency to overestimate your own abilities</p><p>A healthy amount of humility can keep you from assuming you know everything</p><p>It helps to cultivate relationships with people who aren’t afraid to tell you when you’re wrong</p><p><strong>Use-it-or-lose-it Tendency</strong></p><p>All skills attenuate with disuse. Wise people engage in regular practice for their useful skills</p><p>When a skill is raised to fluency, the skill (1) will be lost more slowly and (2) will come back faster when refreshed with new learning</p><p><strong>Drug Misinfluence Tendency</strong></p><p>Drug addicted people tend to believe that they remain in respectable condition, with respectable prospects</p><p>They thus display an extremely unrealistic denial of reality as they go deeper and deeper into deterioration…</p><p>One should stay far away from any conduct at all likely to drift into drug/chemical dependency</p><p>Even a small chance of suffering so great a damage should be avoided</p><p><strong>Senescence-Misinfluence Tendency</strong></p><p>As we get older, our mental abilities decline. It’s going to happen to all of us —there's no stopping it</p><p>It may be possible to slow the decline by continuing to think and learn as you age, so make a commitment to yourself to never stop learning</p><p><strong>Twaddle Tendency</strong></p><p>Humans waste a lot of time talking about nothing at all</p><p>Or by flicking through Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, and suddenly realizing an hour has passed</p><p>Value your time, and stay far away from time-wasters if you need to get serious work done</p><p><strong>Reason-Respecting Tendency</strong></p><p>The tendency of humans to treasure the importance of reasons</p><p>Reasons help to learn, so a teacher provides reasons for teaching certain knowledge rather than laying out the desired belief ex-cathedra with no reasons given</p><p>Unfortunately, this tendency is so strong that even providing meaningless or incorrect reasons will increase compliance with directions or requests</p><p>It's a conditioned reflex, based on a widespread appreciation for reasons</p><p>This has been demonstrated in psychology experiments where participants successfully jump to the head of lines in front of copying machines by explaining their reason: "I have to make some copies."</p><p>When requesting something, add on "because" and watch compliance go up</p><p>Few practices are wiser than not only thinking through reasons before giving directions but also communicating these reasons to the recipient</p><p>It also applies in group decision making: regardless of logic, sometimes having more reasons wins</p><p><strong>Rashomon Effect</strong></p><p>The situation where an event is given contradictory explanations by the individuals involved</p><p>It's a storytelling method in cinema meant to provide different perspectives and points of view of the same incident</p><p>It reflects witnesses subjective interpretation and self-interested advocacy, rather than an objective truth</p><p>The Rashomon effect is evident when the event is the outcome of litigation. One should not be surprised when both parties claim to have won the case</p><p><strong>Paradox of Knowledge</strong></p><p>The more you know, the less you can clearly explain</p><p>Our inability to explain familiar concepts is a form of cognitive bias wherein experts often overestimate the ability of novices</p><p><strong>Hot Hand Fallacy</strong></p><p>Our tendency to believe that a successful streak is likely to lead to further success</p><p>Example: A basketball player made 3 consecutive shots, we may believe they have a greater chance of making the 4th than is actually likely</p><p>Also applies to gambling/investing</p><p><strong>The Turkey Illusion</strong></p><p>A metaphor for the one who is both surprised and harmed by black swan events, i.e., unpredictable events of massive consequences</p><p>"It's never happened in the past, it's unlikely to happen in the future."</p><p>It represents a confusion between risk and uncertainty</p><p>This confusion between risk and uncertainty has baffled investors for centuries</p><p>In a casino, the probabilities of different outcomes are calculable and hence the risk can be controlled</p><p>There’s no unknown-unknown in the sterile environment of a casino</p><p>But, in the real world of business, not only the probabilities of possible outcomes are unknown, but the range of possible outcomes are also unknown</p><p>"Predicting the rain doesn’t count (uncertainty), building an ark does (risk mitigation)." - Warren Buffett</p><p><strong>Lucretius problem</strong></p><p>A mental defect where we assume the worst-case event that has happened is the worst-case event that can ever happen in the future</p><p>We fail to understand that the worst event that has happened in the past surpassed the worst event that came before it</p><p><strong>The Echo Chamber Effect</strong></p><p>We tend to be surrounded by people who are like us and share our worldview</p><p>Social media accentuates this by tailoring our news and opinion feeds to match our pre-set views</p><p>This effect feeds on another fundamental cognitive error called confirmation bias</p><p>To avoid falling into this homogeneity trap, we need to seek out and dispassionately engage with people whose views differ from our own</p><p>This applies not just to political views, but also investments, or life philosophies</p><p><strong>Lucifer Effect</strong></p><p>Human beings underestimate their own vulnerabilities which can turn them into evil</p><p>Demonstrated through the Stanford Prison Experiment where participants were assigned roles of 'prisoners' and 'guards'</p><p>Tests showed all students had no psychological issues</p><p>A few days into the experiment, participants who were playing guards began to treat the prisoners as if they were non-humans</p><p>The prisoners began to experience extreme stress and the more they acted like non-humans, the more the guards mistreated them</p><p>The experiment was supposed to last for two weeks but had to be abruptly ended after 5 days</p><p>Often when we are in a role, we tend to act as others expect</p><p>As a consequence, good people, under certain circumstances, can turn into bad (dishonest, evil, and even dangerous) people</p><p><strong>Pareidolia Effect</strong></p><p>The tendency for our perception to impose a meaningful interpretation on a nebulous stimulus, usually visual, so that one sees an object, pattern, or meaning where there is none</p><p>Examples are perceived images of animals, faces, or objects in cloud formations</p><p><strong>Denominator Blindness</strong></p><p>The failure to put big numbers into proper context.
