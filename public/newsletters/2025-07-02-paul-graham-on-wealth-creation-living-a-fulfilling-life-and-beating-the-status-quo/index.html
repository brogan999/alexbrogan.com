Models from Paul Graham on wealth creation, living a fulfilling life, and beating the status quo Paul Graham is one of the most influential technologists in the world.\nHe’s also written 200+ essays since 1993 that are a gold mine of wisdom on wealth creation, living a fulfilling life, and beating the status quo.\nHere are 16 of the very best mental models from his essays.\nBe GoodBeing good is a competitive advantage.\nIt sets the compass for difficult decisions, allowing accelerated progress.\nIt makes other people want to help you on your mission.\nIt gets you through the inevitable ups-and-downs because you're anchored to purpose.\nHow to Think for YourselfThinking for yourself is life’s greatest competitive advantage—you see opportunities others don’t.\nRead HistoryAsk, “Is it true?”Meet different types of peopleBe less aware of conventional beliefsCultivate independent-minded friendsHow to Cultivate CuriosityAvoid situations that suppress it—stagnant work environments and close-minded people.\nSeek novel environments and situations—travel or communities.\nSeek out topics that engage it.\nIndulge it, by investigating things you're interested in.\nThe Conformist Test”Do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to share with your peers?\nIf the answer is no, you might want to stop and think about that.\nIf everything you believe is something you're supposed to believe, odds are you think what you're told.”\nHow to Work HardIf you want to do great things, you’ll have to work extremely hard.\nDeep interest in a topic makes you work harder than any amount of discipline can.\nBe honest with yourself to know when you’re being lazy or working too hard—find your limit.\nKeep Your Identity SmallWe struggle to think objectively about things that become part of our identity.\nThe more labels we give ourselves, the more emotionally we respond.\nThe best plan is to let as few things into your identity as possible.\nBe nimble and hard to define.\nHow To Get Rich”To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things, measurement and leverage.\nYou need to be in a position where your performance can be measured.\nAnd you have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have a big effect.”\nGood and Bad ProcrastinationGood procrastination is avoiding work that has 0 chance of being mentioned in your obituary—like errands.\n”Unless you're working on the biggest things you could be working on, you're type-B procrastinating, no matter how much you're getting done.”\nThe Top Idea In Your MindThe topic you think about in the shower is “The Top Idea In Your Mind.”\nIf it's not what you want to be thinking about, it might indicate you’re dealing with unwanted problems subconsciously.\nIf so, you may need to change something.\nMean People FailFor most of history, success meant success at zero-sum games—meanness was a competitive advantage.\nIncreasingly, the world is made of positive-sum games.\nYou win not by fighting for control, but by having novel ideas and improving the lives of others.\nManagers Schedule vs. Makers ScheduleThere are two types of schedule.\nManager: The work you do changes every hour.\nThose on a manager’s schedule should understand the cost of interruptions for makers.\nRelentlessly ResourcefulTo win in the startup world, \"making something people want\" is the destination, but \"being relentlessly resourceful\" is how you get there.\nBeing relentless is not enough.\nThe challenges of startups are novel and require novel thinking—resourcefulness.\nHow to Disagree Well”If you have something real to say, being mean gets in the way.\nThe greatest benefit of disagreeing well is not just that it will make conversations better, but that it will make the people who have them happier.”\nSchlep BlindnessThere are great startup ideas lying unexploited right under our noses, but they seem too hard for most.\nSo instead, people tend towards easier, less important ideas.\nDon’t shrink from ‘dirty’ work if it’s on the path to something great.\nh/t - @annavitals\nDo Things That Don’t ScaleUniversally, startups require unscalable efforts to kickstart their growth.\nFor example, recruiting users manually or constraining the product to a narrow market.\nDismissing the need to do “unscalable” things is one of the surest ways to failure.\nThe Economics of Working in Startups\"Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole working life into a few years.\nInstead of working at a low intensity for forty years, you work as hard as you possibly can for four. \"\nThat's it, I hope you enjoyed reading
