Be charitable and assume the best of others.\nHormesisLow doses can have the opposite effect of a high dose. A little bit of sun is good for the body, but too much is bad. Exercising regularly is great, but skipping rest days will destroy your muscles. Apply stress, but not too much.\nBirth LotteryIf you weren‚Äôt born into poverty or another disadvantaged group, you won the birth lottery. You‚Äôve had an easier run at life than many who face poverty, disability, or otherwise. When all else fails, keep your perspective and be thankful for what you‚Äôve got.\nPredictive Coding‚ÄúYou experience, in some sense, the world that you expect to experience.‚Äù\n‚ÄîAndy Clark\nOur perception replaces the unknown with the expected to help us organize our experience of the world efficiently.\nAsk, ‚ÄúWhat might you be over-predicting?‚Äù\nSimulation HypothesisIf computing power continues to increase (AR, VR, etc.), it‚Äôs feasible that one day we could simulate the whole of human consciousness. If that‚Äôs true, then it may be possible that we‚Äôre already living in a simulation‚Äîwe just don‚Äôt know it.\nThe Greatest Happiness Principle Actions are right if they promote happiness, and wrong if they promote unhappiness. If you commit an action that causes happiness without pain, then that action is moral. Act in a way that delivers the most happiness to yourself and others.\nHickam's DictumThe opposite of Occam‚Äôs Razor: the simplest explanation is most likely. In complex systems, problems usually have more than one cause. E.g., In medicine, \"patients can have as many diseases as they damn well please\".\n‚ÄîJohn Hickam\nRemember the context.\nMisconceptions of ChanceWhen we expect the immediate outcome of an event to represent the broader outcomes expected from a large number of iterations.\nLesson: Don't believe that independent events offer influence or meaningful predictive power over future events.\nFailure to Account for Regression to the MeanWe become blindly accepting of changes to our surrounding environment because of limitations in perception.\nWhat feels ‚Äònormal‚Äô to us might be horrible in the eyes of another. When possible, consider alternative perspectives and historical norms.\nShifting Baseline Syndrome Performance always varies around an average true performance.\nExtreme performance naturally gets less extreme the next time, regardless of the intervention.\nLesson: Take account of track records more than one-time success stories.\nThere you have it, 10 mental concepts that will make you smarter.\nI hope you found these as helpful as I have.\nStay curious, Alex\nP.S.
