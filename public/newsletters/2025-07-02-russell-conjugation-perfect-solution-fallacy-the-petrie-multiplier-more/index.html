Start scaling your content marketing efforts like never before here.\nThis Week: 7 mental models that will make you smarter Russell ConjugationWhen someone chooses different words to describe something, depending on how favourable they want to be to what they‚Äôre describing. When reading or listening to others, ask: ‚ÄúAm I forming my opinion based on facts, or the opinion of the writer/speaker?‚Äù\nPerfect Solution FallacyWe reject something because it compares poorly to an ideal that in reality is unattainable.\nWe assume there is a perfect solution to every problem.\nReality is more complicated and trade-offs exist.\nTake the option with the most bearable trade-offs.\nThe Petrie MultiplierStatistically, in a large group, it‚Äôs easy for the majority to avoid identity slurs, while members of the minority group receive an underestimated amount of harassment. This occurs because there are more potential givers than receivers of harassment.\nIntrospection IllusionWe think we understand our motivations and desires, our likes and dislikes.\nWe believe we know ourselves and why we are the way we are.\nIn reality, when asked to explain our emotional states, we typically make something up.\nDig deeper, reflect more.\nCausal ReductionismFalsely attributing an outcome to a single cause when there were actually several. John: I crashed my car because a Cat ran in front of it. Policeman: So it wasn‚Äôt because you were texting your girlfriend \u0026 driving drunk?\nRemember the full context. Prototype TheoryWe take things around us and compare them to pre-existing mental ‚ÄùPrototypes‚Äù for likeness to reduce our processing load. Sadly, this blocks new information \u0026 forces us to focus on pre-existing ideas.\nRemember: Be open and flexible to new interpretations. False DichotomyA persuasion tactic involving presenting only two options or possibilities when more exist.\nThe presenter makes the audience believe the options are black or white‚Äînot something in between. Always ask: ‚ÄúDo more choices exist?‚Äù when presented binary choices. There you have it, 7 mental models that will make you smarter.¬†I hope you enjoyed them!\nAlex\nP.S.
