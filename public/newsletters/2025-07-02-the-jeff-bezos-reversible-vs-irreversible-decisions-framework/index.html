We want to combine the extraordinary customer-serving capabilities that are enabled by size with the speed of movement, nimbleness, and risk-acceptance mentality normally associated with entrepreneurial start-ups.\nCan we do it? I’m optimistic. We have a good start on it, and I think our culture puts us in a position to achieve the goal. But I don’t think it’ll be easy. There are some subtle traps that even high-performing large organizations can fall into as a matter of course, and we’ll have to learn as an institution how to guard against them. One common pitfall for large organizations – one that hurts speed and inventiveness – is “one-size-fits-all” decision making.\"\nJeff Bezos\nEnter: 'Reversible' and 'Irreversible' decisions.\nWe often think that collecting more information will help us make better decisions.\nSometimes that's true, but most of the time it prevents forward progress.\nOther times it can be the difference between success or failure.\nTo avoid this trap, Bezos asks himself, \"Is this a reversible or irreversible decision?\"\nIrreversible decisions are 'one-way doors.'\nIf you walk through them and don't like what you see, you can't get back to where you were before.\nThey must be made slowly and deliberately.\n\"Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible – one-way doors – and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions.\"\nJeff Bezos\nOn the other hand, reversible decisions are 'two-way doors.'\nIf you make a suboptimal reversible decision, you don't have to live with the consequences forever.\nYou can reopen the door and go back through.\nThese decisions can and should be made quickly.\n\"Most decisions are changeable, reversible – they’re two-way doors. If you’ve made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don’t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups.\"\nJeff Bezos\nIt's important to note that irreversible and reversible decisions exist on a continuum—they're not binary.\nYou need to plot your decision against each spectrum to determine the importance of the decision.\n@BrandonMChu illustrates this process as well as key criteria here:\nHe breaks down decision importance into 3 dimensions:1/ Resource investment from a decision\n2/ The overall impact of a positive outcome\n3/ The impacts of a negative outcome\nThe process involves plotting a point along each spectrum to determine overall importance.\nSo, how can we apply this framework to our own lives?Step 1: Determine whether the decision is reversible\nStep 2: If it's reversible, have confidence in making the decision quickly\nStep 3: For irreversible decisions, slow down and gather more information before deciding\nReversible decisions aren't an excuse to act recklessly.\nThey're a recognition that the ability to make decisions quickly is a competitive and life advantage.\nAs General George Patton said, “A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week.”\nOnce you start using this framework, you'll quickly learn that the vast majority of decisions are reversible.\nThis will unlock considerable progress for yourself, your career, or your business.\nWe should always aspire to speed, because time is the one resource we lack most.\nFear of failure and perfectionism is one of the greatest barriers to individual and collective human progress.\nMuch of overcoming these is learning when to go fast and when to go slow.\nThe irreversible vs. reversible decisions framework allows you to do that.\nThat's it!
