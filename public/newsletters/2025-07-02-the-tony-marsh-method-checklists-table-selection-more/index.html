If you want to learn French, donâ€™t spend time in the classroom, speak to native speakers in France. Your memory will improve. ChecklistsChecklists are valuable for two reasons: (1) Improving or automating is easier once the steps are on paper. (2) Perfect process is guaranteed, minimizing the scope for errors. Where can you use a checklist to improve or automate steps in your life or work? Table SelectionThe game you playâ€”or the table you selectâ€”is more important than how you play. You donâ€™t need to get good at doing difficult things if you get good at avoiding difficult things. If you want to win, pick an easy table and nail your execution. AntifragilityAntifragility is benefitting from disorder, change, or unexpected events.\nThe things that have survived the longest in the universe have an antifragile system in placeâ€”the things that havenâ€™t, donâ€™t. To succeed long-term, we should strive to be antifragile.\nLindy EffectNon-perishable objects, ideas, or technologies are expected to live proportionally to their current age. Something lives for 50 years, itâ€™s expected to live for another 50 years. Every further year implies a longer remaining life expectancy.\nh/t Albert Goldman\nThe Chimpanzee TestWhen chimpanzees have a better test score than people basing their decisions on either â€˜knowledgeâ€™ or â€˜educatedâ€™ guesses. We know less than we think we do.\nThink twice before making â€˜educatedâ€™ statements on global issues.\nHalfpinionThe act of ignoring one-half of a topic (costs or benefits).\nIf you want to convince people to change their opinions, always compare the full costs to the full benefits. A full opinion is credible. And credible people change minds. h/t @ScottAdamsSays\nChesterton's FenceDonâ€™t remove a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place. Unless we know why a decision was made, we canâ€™t safely conclude it was wrongâ€”there may be hidden reasons.\nThe first step to modifying an existing system is to fully understand it. There you have it, 8 mental models that will make you smarter.\nI hope you found these as helpful as I have.\nStay curious, Alex\nP.S. â€” If you're looking for a new gig, I might be able to help!\nI've recently started an application-only talent collective to help you find your next big play.Â Members of the A Players Talent Collective get warm intros to companies vetted by meâ€”including Figma, Stripe, Coinbase, Brex, Peloton, Affirm, Amazon, Paypal, and many more.Â It's completely free for candidates.
