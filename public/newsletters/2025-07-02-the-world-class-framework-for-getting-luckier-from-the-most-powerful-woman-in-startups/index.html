This is world-class.”\nBut the fact remained, he would always push:\n”Is this really the best that a five-year old could ever do?”\nA constant message—to give her best effort—that she could never quite escape.\nAfter receiving a financial aid package to Yale, Miura-Ko was required to complete 10 hours of work study per week.\nShe found herself in the office of the Dean of Engineering.\nThe day before she goes to her first day of work, she calls her parents.\nHer Dad gets on the phone and says, “Make sure you do a world-class job.”\nAnn responds, “I’m photocopying and filing. There’s no such thing as world-class there.”\nAnd He says, “Well, I’d still think about it.”\nSo, on her first day, Ann finds herself standing in front of the photocopying machine with a stack of papers thinking:\n”What is world-class in this situation?”\nShe decided it was photocopies where you couldn’t tell it was a photocopy—they would look like the originals.\nAnn had many more menial tasks—like getting donuts for the office and labelling files—and every step of the way she would ask herself:\n”What does world-class look like?”\nNo matter how small or boring, she completed each task to the best of her ability without hesitation.\nAnn continued this for two years, unnoticed, until one day...\nThe Dean of Engineering, Allan Bromley—a legendary physicist who’d worked under George Bush, Sr.—poked his head out of his office to see that his executive assistant was out.\nHe saw Ann and he said, “Who are you?”\nShe responded, “I’m Ann Miura. I’m your student assistant in this office.”\nAnd he said, “Oh, I’ve heard of you. I need you to go and give my friend a tour of the engineering facilities.”\n”I know you’ll do a good job. Sarah (the EA) has told me you’re great.”\nSo, Ann proceeds to take the friend on a tour of the engineering facilities.\nThey get along very well and discover that they both come from Palo Alto near San Francisco.\nThe friend stops in the middle of the conversation and asks, “Hey, what are you doing for spring break?”\nAnn was planning on going back to Palo Alto.\n”Well, that’s great, because I’m wondering if you want to come and shadow me and see what I do for a living?”\nAnn realises she’s spent the whole conversation speaking about herself and hasn’t asked this guy what he did for a living.\nSo, she asks, “Well, what do you do for a living?”\nThe man responds, “I’m (Lew Platt) the CEO of Hewlett-Packard.”\nAnn realises her mistake—doing what any junior would do in talking about themselves—but quickly responds:\n“I think that would be amazing to shadow you.”\nSo, that spring break, Ann joins Lew in his daily life as the CEO of HP.\nThey would drive around together, attend meetings together, and do all of the things that Lew had to do.\nOne day, Bill Gates came to make an announcement about .net with Hewlett-Packard.\nLew invited Ann to attend the meeting and see everything ‘backstage.’\nHe also invited the photographer in—which Ann didn’t think much of at the time—and he asked for a photo of Him and Ann talking to each other.\nA few months later, after the fact, Ann receives some mail...\nIt’s a thank you letter that reads, “Thanks for coming to visit. I thought you would enjoy these photographs.”\nThe first photograph shows Ann and Lew sitting next to each other talking.\nThe second photograph shows Bill—sitting in the exact same seat as Ann was—talking to Lew.\nLew had tried to open Ann’s mind to the possibility that she could one day be sitting where Bill Gates was—she just had to see herself there first.\nHe saw something in Ann and said, “You know what? You have something and I see it. I’m going to show you something even greater.”\nAnn recalls, “It was such a gift. It was so incredible because I hadn’t ever thought about my own personal potential ever.”\nFrom that moment, a raft of new opportunities opened up for Ann including a mentorship with Lew Platt—CEO of HP.\nHer career was officially launched.\nBut, it all comes back to one moment.\nThe moment that Allan Bromley—the Dean of Engineering—sticks his head out of his office needing an important job done.\nHe didn’t recognize Ann, but he knew her name.\nMore importantly, he knew that Ann was known for doing a great job.\nIt’s hard to find meaning in menial or boring tasks.\nThere’s often no immediate payoff that comes with them—like any good habit, there’s no immediate gratification.\nWe just want to get them done as quickly as possible so we can get on with the real, more interesting work.\nBut, this is a mistake.\nBecause how you do anything is how you do everything.\nYour personal brand is the summation of the thousands of micro-acts you put in over the course of your career or life.\nIt’s what you do when no one is looking or expecting you to do a great job.\nAnd the surest way in life to find luck is to make sure you give your very best in each and every one of those moments.\nBecause you never know what might be around the corner.\nAnd you never know when doing your best will lead to a life-changing opportunity.\nRemember:Every day, you’re not just working for someone else.\nYou’re working for your future self.\nYou’re your own boss—the boss of the ‘luck’ that will eventually come your way.\nMake the choice to increase your luck by being ‘world-class’ in everything you do.\nIf you want to dive deeper on Ann’s story, you can find the original conversation that @annimaniac discusses this life-changing moment on the @tferriss show:\nAnn Miura-Ko — The Path from Shyness to World-Class Debater and Investor (#331)\nPhoto: Christopher Michel (@chrismichel) “The main difference was that I was willing to outwork and outdo every competitor who walked in through that door.” — Ann Miura-Ko ...\ntim.blog\nThat's it, I hope you enjoyed reading :)‍\n","wordCount":"1279","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-07-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-07-02T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://alexbrogan.com/newsletters/2025-07-02-the-world-class-framework-for-getting-luckier-from-the-most-powerful-woman-in-startups/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Alex Brogan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://alexbrogan.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://alexbrogan.com/ accesskey=h title="Alex Brogan (Alt + H)">Alex Brogan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
