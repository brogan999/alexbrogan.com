This week focused on psychological biases and general thinking concepts.\nAs you read through, I would love if you could consider the following questions (please shoot me a response if you'd like to give feedback on either of them!):\nWas the level of explanation sufficient to understand the concept?Would you like to see each week 'themed' by topic, or would you prefer a mix of fields each week?\nAs always, if you get value out of this, I'd appreciate you sharing it or my Twitter profile on Twitter so others can get value out of it too :)\nConcepts in PsychologyTilt: A frustrated, confused state of mind caused by the emotional stress of losing (particularly in strategic games like poker)\nTilting degrades skill, so tilting less allows you to beat people better than you because you're playing at your skill cap more often than they are\nDo/Say Something Syndrome: Waiting and watching is torture, so humans tend to act even when no action is needed\nWe often confuse activity for results. Sometimes, the best thing to do or say in the face of a problem, question, or situation is nothing at all\nAvailability Bias: Our tendency to rely on information that is easy to recall or top of mind when making decisions\nWhen decision-making, gain different perspectives and relevant statistical information rather than relying purely on first judgments and emotive influences\nInsensitivity to Base Rates (Representativeness Heuristic)\nIn statistics, a base rate is the % of a population with a certain characteristic\nInsensitivity occurs when we put heavier weight on appealing information about an individual case, rather than considering the average outcome over time\nInsensitivity to Sample Size (Representativeness Heuristic)\nExtreme outcomes are more likely in small than in large samples\nBefore drawing a conclusion from information about a limited number of events (sample) selected from a larger number of events (population) understand the statistics of samples\nMisconceptions of Chance (Representativeness Heuristic)\nExpecting the immediate outcome of events to represent the broader outcomes expected from a large number of trials\nDon't believe that independent events offer influence or meaningful predictive power over future events\nFailure to Account for Regression to the Mean (Representativeness Heuristic)\nPerformance always varies around an average true performance. Extreme performance naturally gets less extreme the next time, regardless of the intervention\nTake account of track records more than one-time success stories\nBias from Conjunction Fallacy (Representativeness Heuristic)\nBelieving that two events happening in conjunction is more probable than one of those events happening alone\nWhich is more probable?\na) Linda is a bank teller\nb) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement\nAre you sure?\nIncentives and Reinforcement Bias: Our tendency to neglect the importance of incentives in understanding human behaviour\nDon't think of something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives\nShow me the incentives and I'll show you the outcome\nSelf Serving Bias: Believing your failures are due to external factors, yet you're responsible for your successes\nDon't forget your unearned privileges, luck and advantages\nDon't blame circumstance or point the finger when things don't go your way\nDeprival Super-Reaction Syndrome: If our freedom, status, money or anything we value is lost, we will over-react in a negative manner\nThis effect is even greater when we almost have something but then lose it\nDon't let your reaction cloud your judgement of the next best steps\nContrast Effect: Reduced perceptive performance as a result of simultaneous exposure to two objects of lesser or greater value in the same dimension (Think of two product pricing options side-by-side)\nAntidote: Evaluate people and objects individually and not by their contrast\nStress-Influence Bias: Stress is good, up to a point, but will then amplify the other biases\nLight stress can slightly improve performance—say, in examinations—whereas heavy stress causes dysfunction\nLimit your major decisions while over-stressed, or de-stress first\nEmotional Arousal Bias: The tendency for arousal to enhance memory for high priority information but reduce memory for low priority information\nAn explanation for why catastrophic events can lead victims without any recollection of the \"minor\" details surrounding the main event\nPhysical or Psychological Pain Bias: The tendency to distort facts for our own psychological comfort\nThis psychological comfort is known as cognitive dissonance\nFace the truth: It's better to deal with problems before they become bigger problems\nFundamental Attribution Error: Underemphasizing situational factors while over-emphasizing character traits in assessing others\nYou haven't slept well so you know why you're slow, they haven't slept well so you assume they're a slow person\nView other's situations with charity\nStatus Quo Bias: We tend to prefer things to stay the same; changes from the baseline are considered to be a loss\nPresent in all corners of society; people tend to reject change for psychological or physical comfort\nWhy seek change or discomfort? Growth\nDo Nothing Tendency: We are more bothered by harm that comes from action than harm that comes from inaction, so we default to no action\nMost of us have two lives: the life we live, and the unlived life within us - @SPressfield\nDon't resort to no action as a means of comfort\nPrecision Bias: The tendency to believe that greater precision implies greater accuracy\nCollecting an impressive quantity of statistics or evidence even though they may be of little value for demonstrating any particular truth\nAsk: What is the 80/20 here?\nSimplicity Bias: The tendency to hold views that can be explained by a simple narrative, as opposed to views that take more complex details into account and are generally more balanced\nLikely caused by limitations of individual memory and closely related to confirmation bias\nUncertainty Avoidance: The tendency to interpret information, people or things that are inconsistent, vague, or contradictory as potential sources of psychological discomfort or threat\nIt's important to separate risk from uncertainty: they are not the same\nIdeological Bias: The collection of ideas, or beliefs, held by an individual, or a group of people; it's the tendency to be influenced to see reality from only a particular viewpoint\nPolitical parties have an ideology they hold to, this makes their views ideologically biased\nNot Invented Here Bias: We get drunk on our own ideas (whether individual or in a business setting)\nSober up, take a step back every now and then to examine their quality in hindsight\nWhich of your ideas from the past 5 years were truly outstanding? My guess is a small few\nExtremeness Aversion: When making decisions, the tendency to avoid the outermost edge or ultimate poles of a situation and prefer a compromise or middle position\nThe middle option on a software product page is conveniently placed, isn't it?\nSocial Proof Bias: In the face of uncertainty, the tendency to look to others for answers as to how we should behave, what we should think and what we should do\nOccurs due to our natural desire to 'fit' in with the crowd\nBut, we should always question whether the crowd is wrong\nFraming Effect: Allowing ourselves to be overly influenced by context and delivery\nWe like to think that we think independently, but the truth is we are influenced by delivery, framing, and subtle cues (think Ads or Politics)\nBe mindful of how messages are being put to you\nLollapalooza Effect: Extreme consequences arising from confluences of psychological biases acting in favor of a particular outcome\nFor example, auctions can generate foolish behaviour (ending in regret), because of social proof, loss aversion (FOMO), commitment, and action bias\nPeak-End Theory: A cognitive shortcut our brains use by focusing our memories on the most intense aspects of an experience or what the ending was like\nA bad flight experience on the way home from a vacation can take away from an otherwise positive trip\nConfirmation Bias: Favouring things that confirm our existing beliefs and ignoring or dismissing information that conflicts with them\nThis has been labelled as the mother of all biases, as it affects so much of our thinking\nQuestion your beliefs and seek disconfirming evidence\nScope Neglect: A lack of sensitivity to the scale of a benefit or harm\nEven if there is an exponential increase in the scope of a problem, our response in attention may only be linear\nDon't trust your intuition when dealing with numbers, do the work to understand the problem\nCognitive Dissonance: The mental discomfort that results from holding two conflicting beliefs, values, or attitudes\nExample: Justifying 'cheating' when dieting\nCan result naturally, or from a lack of focused reflection and investigation of our deepest beliefs or attitudes\nIllusory Truth Effect: Believing false information to be correct after repeated exposure\nRepetition makes statements easier to process relative to new ones, leading people to believe that the repeated conclusion is more truthful\nThe antidote: keep questioning everything\nCue-Dependent Forgetting: Memories are forgotten because they can't be retrieved, not because they don't exist\nInformation is stored in human memory by way of association with other memories\nAttach new memories to old memories and you'll retrieve them more quickly\nMood-Congruent Memory Bias: The tendency to more easily remember events that have congruence with one's current mood\nRemember: It's never as good or as bad as it seems\nBias from Association: The tendency to be easily influenced by associations\nHighly-priced goods = high-quality goods. Cheap goods = cheap quality\nNot always the case. Take things at face value\nLiking/Loving Bias: The tendency to judge in favour of people and symbols we like, or ignore their faults\nWhen dealing with those who clearly benefit from your liking, check whether you've been influenced\nDon't distort the facts of a situation to comply with your liking\nDisliking/Hating Bias: The tendency to distort facts to facilitate hatred or disdain\nTake opinions and behaviours at face value rather than in the veil of your disliking or hatred for someone or something\nCommitment and Consistency Bias: The instinctual desire to remain consistent with our prior actions and beliefs\nSociety values consistency, but this can lead us to behave in irrational ways\nAlways reflect on whether you truly want to continue a commitment of any sort\nKantian Fairness Tendency: The pursuit of and belief in perfect fairness in the world\nStop expecting the world to be fair and adjust your behaviour accordingly\nBad things happen to good people and good things happen to bad people: this is the way of the world\nBias from Jealousy/Envy: The tendency to dislike those who make us feel our own inferiority\nJealousy involves a triangle of relationships. Envy involves the self and another\nIt's no wonder workplaces don't like you telling your colleagues the value of your bonus\nReciprocation Bias: The tendency to reciprocate actions others have done towards us\nCulturally and societally enshrined: \"One should treat others as they would like to be treated\"\nBeware of ill-intentioned actions or relationships that feel transactional\nAuthority Bias: The tendency to trust and be influenced by the opinions of authority figures\nExperts aren't always right. Influencers don't always have valuable opinions. Your boss doesn't own your thinking\nTake opinions on their logic, not their sender\nHindsight Bias: The tendency, upon learning an outcome, to overestimate one's ability to have foreseen the outcome\nThe \"I knew it all along phenomenon\"\nSolution? Decision journals and honest self-assessment\nMere exposure effect: The tendency to develop a preference for things merely because we're familiar with them\nCritical in decision-making; when deciding between alternatives, we shouldn't choose the familiar option, we should choose the best option based on its effectiveness\nConservatism bias: Emphasizing original or pre-existing information over new information\nHighly applicable to decision-makers when reacting to new developments in their field\nNew information should be analyzed carefully to determine its value\nSocial Desirability Bias: Our tendency to respond in ways that we feel are more appropriate or socially acceptable to others, even if we're untruthful\nEnter: The anonymous survey\nIdentifiable Victim Bias: We feel greater empathy in situations where tragedies are about a specific, identifiable individual, compared to situations where the victims are a larger, vaguer group of people\n\"A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.”\nPeltzman Effect: The theory that when safety measures are implemented, people actually tend to increase their risky behaviors\nWhy? People’s perception of risk decreases, and so people may feel that they can now afford to make riskier decisions\nOmission Bias: The tendency to view harmful inactions as more morally sound than harmful actions\nExample 1: Referees avoiding game altering calls near the end of tight games\nExample 2: Not vaccinating even though the probability of harm is greater without vaccination\nIn-group Bias: We favour those with perceived or real similarities to ourselves: race/ethnicity, country of origin, sporting team, political views, etc.\nAreas where awareness of ingroup bias is important: Hiring, promotions, politics, capital allocation, team selection\nMoral Foundations Theory: We have ingrained ‘intuitive morals’ which drive all our behaviours\nThey include:\nCare: instinct to protect\nPurity: disgust for the foul\nFairness: instinct to punish cheating\nLoyalty: how tied you feel to others\nAuthority: knowing when to obey\nWe're prewired with the five modules, but each of them can be amplified or toned down by our personality, environment, and experiences\nThe outcome is differing moral and political views across and within cultures\nTo avoid political or moral 'high-ground' shouting-matches, seek first to understand the opponent's moral foundations\nYou'll have a more fruitful conversation and learn a new valuable perspective\nDecline of Violence: The modern world is witnessing a massive decline in all forms of violence such as war, crime, and interpersonal relationships (see@sapinker's The Better Angels of Our Nature), yet we are accustomed to thinking the modern world is increasingly violent\nThis thinking comes from the persistently horrific stories in the news: murders, geopolitical wars, abuse\nIt results from the availability bias: the tendency to judge the probability of an event occurring based on how easily it comes to mind\nSince the news disproportionately reports on bad things happening (that's what gets clicks!), we overestimate how common these rare bad events are because they are fresh in our memory\nAntidote: Remember the whole story, not just the available story\nFox vs. Hedgehogs\nThere are two types of people in the world: foxes and hedgehogs\nThe dichotomy describes two contrasting ways of viewing the world\nIf you adopt foxlike thinking, you rely on various pieces of information to form your view on an issue and think about it from different angles\nIf you adopt a hedgehog mindset, your world views and predictions are formed with a central, overarching principle in mind\nFoxes are willing to admit when they're uncertain in the face of difficult problems\nHedgehogs are more confident in their views, regardless of the uncertainty of the problem at hand\nUnsurprisingly, people with foxlike characteristics tend to make more accurate predictions when it comes to global trends and events\nThe best forecasters put their own theories aside, embrace uncertainty, and use multiple perspectives to achieve a more accurate prediction\nBandwagon Effect: Ideas, fads, and beliefs grow as more people adopt them\nThis concept has heavy overlap with Social Proof and the Technology Adoption Lifecyle\nA lot of modern marketing techniques can be explained through these concepts\nGroupthink: Due to a desire to 'fit-in' and to retain harmony in group settings, we make irrational decisions, often to minimise conflict\nSolutions? Six thinking hats, write storming, and any other process that forces more objective group decision-making\nHalo Effect: The tendency to assume other agreeable characteristics upon seeing one agreeable characteristic in someone or something\n\" He could never have done that; he's too nice!”\nMoral Luck: Where someone is assigned blame or praise for an action or its consequences even if it's clear that the person didn't have full control over the action or its consequences\nAssess voluntary actions, not uncontrollable outcomes\nFalse consensus: The tendency to believe that your views and behaviours are more common and appropriate to existing circumstances than they are\n\"What, you don't drink alcohol?!”\nCurse of knowledge: Once we know something, we assume everyone else knows it, too\nIt's why some experts can't explain their field in simple terms\nand people don't share knowledge that could benefit others; there are always people to teach and people to learn from\nSpotlight effect: We overestimate how much people are paying attention to our behaviour and appearance\nHard truth that will pull the weight off your shoulders: People care far more about themselves than they care about you\nSimple but hard antidote: Just be you\nDefensive Attribution: When someone attributes blame for a mishap to minimize their fear of being a victim or a cause in a similar situation\nAttributing blame allows the person to believe that the mishap was controllable and thus preventable\nExample: you want to feel better or less scared after a car crash happens in front of you\nYou blame one of the drivers for being on their phone and tell yourself it couldn't have happened otherwise\nInterestingly, the willingness of the attributor to apportion blame to the person(s) involved has been found to decrease with the perceived similarities between the two parties\nI.e., there is an \"In-group bias\" that occurs\nJust-World Hypothesis: We tend to believe the world is a just place; therefore, we assume acts of injustice are deserved and vice-versa\nThis is not always the case: good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people\nHowever, it's refreshing and powerful to think that good equals good\nWithout this hypothesis, the motivation to do good would dissolve\nThat's it, thanks for reading!If you got value out of this, I'd appreciate you sharing it or my Twitter profile on Twitter so others can get wiser too :)\nPlease send me a reply if you have feedback on either of the following questions:\nWas the level of explanation sufficient to understand the concept?Would you like to see each week 'themed' by topic, or would you prefer a mix of fields each week?‍\n","wordCount":"3062","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-07-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-07-02T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://alexbrogan.com/newsletters/2025-07-02-tilt-do-say-something-syndrome-availability-bias-more/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Alex Brogan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://alexbrogan.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://alexbrogan.com/ accesskey=h title="Alex Brogan (Alt + H)">Alex Brogan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

Extreme performance naturally gets less extreme the next time, regardless of the intervention</p><p>Take account of track records more than one-time success stories</p><p><strong>Bias from Conjunction Fallacy (Representativeness Heuristic)</strong></p><p>Believing that two events happening in conjunction is more probable than one of those events happening alone</p><p>Which is more probable?</p><p>a) Linda is a bank teller</p><p>b) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement</p><p>Are you sure?</p><p><strong>Incentives and Reinforcement Bias:</strong> Our tendency to neglect the importance of incentives in understanding human behaviour</p><p>Don't think of something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives</p><p>Show me the incentives and I'll show you the outcome</p><p><strong>Self Serving Bias:</strong> Believing your failures are due to external factors, yet you're responsible for your successes</p><p>Don't forget your unearned privileges, luck and advantages</p><p>Don't blame circumstance or point the finger when things don't go your way</p><p><strong>Deprival Super-Reaction Syndrome:</strong> If our freedom, status, money or anything we value is lost, we will over-react in a negative manner</p><p>This effect is even greater when we almost have something but then lose it</p><p>Don't let your reaction cloud your judgement of the next best steps</p><p><strong>Contrast Effect:</strong> Reduced perceptive performance as a result of simultaneous exposure to two objects of lesser or greater value in the same dimension (Think of two product pricing options side-by-side)</p><p>Antidote: Evaluate people and objects individually and not by their contrast</p><p><strong>Stress-Influence Bias: </strong>Stress is good, up to a point, but will then amplify the other biases</p><p>Light stress can slightly improve performance—say, in examinations—whereas heavy stress causes dysfunction</p><p>Limit your major decisions while over-stressed, or de-stress first</p><p><strong>Emotional Arousal Bias:</strong> The tendency for arousal to enhance memory for high priority information but reduce memory for low priority information</p><p>An explanation for why catastrophic events can lead victims without any recollection of the "minor" details surrounding the main event</p><p><strong>Physical or Psychological Pain Bias:</strong> The tendency to distort facts for our own psychological comfort</p><p>This psychological comfort is known as cognitive dissonance</p><p>Face the truth: It's better to deal with problems before they become bigger problems</p><p><strong>Fundamental Attribution Error:</strong> Underemphasizing situational factors while over-emphasizing character traits in assessing others</p><p>You haven't slept well so you know why you're slow, they haven't slept well so you assume they're a slow person</p><p>View other's situations with charity</p><p><strong>Status Quo Bias:</strong> We tend to prefer things to stay the same; changes from the baseline are considered to be a loss</p><p>Present in all corners of society; people tend to reject change for psychological or physical comfort</p><p>Why seek change or discomfort? Growth</p><p><strong>Do Nothing Tendency:</strong> We are more bothered by harm that comes from action than harm that comes from inaction, so we default to no action</p><p>Most of us have two lives: the life we live, and the unlived life within us - @SPressfield</p><p>Don't resort to no action as a means of comfort</p><p><strong>Precision Bias: </strong>The tendency to believe that greater precision implies greater accuracy</p><p>Collecting an impressive quantity of statistics or evidence even though they may be of little value for demonstrating any particular truth</p><p>Ask: What is the 80/20 here?</p><p><strong>Simplicity Bias:</strong> The tendency to hold views that can be explained by a simple narrative, as opposed to views that take more complex details into account and are generally more balanced</p><p>Likely caused by limitations of individual memory and closely related to confirmation bias</p><p><strong>Uncertainty Avoidance:</strong> The tendency to interpret information, people or things that are inconsistent, vague, or contradictory as potential sources of psychological discomfort or threat</p><p>It's important to separate risk from uncertainty: they are not the same</p><p><strong>Ideological Bias:</strong> The collection of ideas, or beliefs, held by an individual, or a group of people; it's the tendency to be influenced to see reality from only a particular viewpoint</p><p>Political parties have an ideology they hold to, this makes their views ideologically biased</p><p><strong>Not Invented Here Bias:</strong> We get drunk on our own ideas (whether individual or in a business setting)</p><p>Sober up, take a step back every now and then to examine their quality in hindsight</p><p>Which of your ideas from the past 5 years were truly outstanding? My guess is a small few</p><p><strong>Extremeness Aversion:</strong> When making decisions, the tendency to avoid the outermost edge or ultimate poles of a situation and prefer a compromise or middle position</p><p>The middle option on a software product page is conveniently placed, isn't it?</p><p><strong>Social Proof Bias:</strong> In the face of uncertainty, the tendency to look to others for answers as to how we should behave, what we should think and what we should do</p><p>Occurs due to our natural desire to 'fit' in with the crowd</p><p>But, we should always question whether the crowd is wrong</p><p><strong>Framing Effect:</strong> Allowing ourselves to be overly influenced by context and delivery</p><p>We like to think that we think independently, but the truth is we are influenced by delivery, framing, and subtle cues (think Ads or Politics)</p><p>Be mindful of how messages are being put to you</p><p><strong>Lollapalooza Effect:</strong> Extreme consequences arising from confluences of psychological biases acting in favor of a particular outcome</p><p>For example, auctions can generate foolish behaviour (ending in regret), because of social proof, loss aversion (FOMO), commitment, and action bias</p><p><strong>Peak-End Theory:</strong> A cognitive shortcut our brains use by focusing our memories on the most intense aspects of an experience or what the ending was like</p><p>A bad flight experience on the way home from a vacation can take away from an otherwise positive trip</p><p><strong>Confirmation Bias:</strong> Favouring things that confirm our existing beliefs and ignoring or dismissing information that conflicts with them</p><p>This has been labelled as the mother of all biases, as it affects so much of our thinking</p><p>Question your beliefs and seek disconfirming evidence</p><p><strong>Scope Neglect:</strong> A lack of sensitivity to the scale of a benefit or harm</p><p>Even if there is an exponential increase in the scope of a problem, our response in attention may only be linear</p><p>Don't trust your intuition when dealing with numbers, do the work to understand the problem</p><p><strong>Cognitive Dissonance:</strong> The mental discomfort that results from holding two conflicting beliefs, values, or attitudes</p><p>Example: Justifying 'cheating' when dieting</p><p>Can result naturally, or from a lack of focused reflection and investigation of our deepest beliefs or attitudes</p><p><strong>Illusory Truth Effect:</strong> Believing false information to be correct after repeated exposure</p><p>Repetition makes statements easier to process relative to new ones, leading people to believe that the repeated conclusion is more truthful</p><p>The antidote: keep questioning everything</p><p><strong>Cue-Dependent Forgetting:</strong> Memories are forgotten because they can't be retrieved, not because they don't exist</p><p>Information is stored in human memory by way of association with other memories</p><p>Attach new memories to old memories and you'll retrieve them more quickly</p><p><strong>Mood-Congruent Memory Bias:</strong> The tendency to more easily remember events that have congruence with one's current mood</p><p>Remember: It's never as good or as bad as it seems</p><p><strong>Bias from Association:</strong> The tendency to be easily influenced by associations</p><p>Highly-priced goods = high-quality goods. Cheap goods = cheap quality</p><p>Not always the case. Take things at face value</p><p><strong>Liking/Loving Bias: </strong>The tendency to judge in favour of people and symbols we like, or ignore their faults</p><p>When dealing with those who clearly benefit from your liking, check whether you've been influenced</p><p>Don't distort the facts of a situation to comply with your liking</p><p><strong>Disliking/Hating Bias:</strong> The tendency to distort facts to facilitate hatred or disdain</p><p>Take opinions and behaviours at face value rather than in the veil of your disliking or hatred for someone or something</p><p><strong>Commitment and Consistency Bias:</strong> The instinctual desire to remain consistent with our prior actions and beliefs</p><p>Society values consistency, but this can lead us to behave in irrational ways</p><p>Always reflect on whether you truly want to continue a commitment of any sort</p><p><strong>Kantian Fairness Tendency:</strong> The pursuit of and belief in perfect fairness in the world</p><p>Stop expecting the world to be fair and adjust your behaviour accordingly</p><p>Bad things happen to good people and good things happen to bad people: this is the way of the world</p><p><strong>Bias from Jealousy/Envy:</strong> The tendency to dislike those who make us feel our own inferiority</p><p>Jealousy involves a triangle of relationships. Envy involves the self and another</p><p>It's no wonder workplaces don't like you telling your colleagues the value of your bonus</p><p><strong>Reciprocation Bias:</strong> The tendency to reciprocate actions others have done towards us</p><p>Culturally and societally enshrined: "One should treat others as they would like to be treated"</p><p>Beware of ill-intentioned actions or relationships that feel transactional</p><p><strong>Authority Bias:</strong> The tendency to trust and be influenced by the opinions of authority figures</p><p>Experts aren't always right. Influencers don't always have valuable opinions. Your boss doesn't own your thinking</p><p>Take opinions on their logic, not their sender</p><p><strong>Hindsight Bias:</strong> The tendency, upon learning an outcome, to overestimate one's ability to have foreseen the outcome</p><p>The "I knew it all along phenomenon"</p><p>Solution? Decision journals and honest self-assessment</p><p><strong>Mere exposure effect:</strong> The tendency to develop a preference for things merely because we're familiar with them</p><p>Critical in decision-making; when deciding between alternatives, we shouldn't choose the familiar option, we should choose the best option based on its effectiveness</p><p><strong>Conservatism bias:</strong> Emphasizing original or pre-existing information over new information</p><p>Highly applicable to decision-makers when reacting to new developments in their field</p><p>New information should be analyzed carefully to determine its value</p><p><strong>Social Desirability Bias:</strong> Our tendency to respond in ways that we feel are more appropriate or socially acceptable to others, even if we're untruthful</p><p>Enter: The anonymous survey</p><p><strong>Identifiable Victim Bias:</strong> We feel greater empathy in situations where tragedies are about a specific, identifiable individual, compared to situations where the victims are a larger, vaguer group of people</p><p>"A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.”</p><p><strong>Peltzman Effect:</strong> The theory that when safety measures are implemented, people actually tend to increase their risky behaviors</p><p>Why? People’s perception of risk decreases, and so people may feel that they can now afford to make riskier decisions</p><p><strong>Omission Bias:</strong> The tendency to view harmful inactions as more morally sound than harmful actions</p><p>Example 1: Referees avoiding game altering calls near the end of tight games</p><p>Example 2: Not vaccinating even though the probability of harm is greater without vaccination</p><p><strong>In-group Bias:</strong> We favour those with perceived or real similarities to ourselves: race/ethnicity, country of origin, sporting team, political views, etc.</p><p>Areas where awareness of ingroup bias is important: Hiring, promotions, politics, capital allocation, team selection</p><p><strong>Moral Foundations Theory:</strong> We have ingrained ‘intuitive morals’ which drive all our behaviours</p><p>They include:</p><p>Care: instinct to protect</p><p>Purity: disgust for the foul</p><p>Fairness: instinct to punish cheating</p><p>Loyalty: how tied you feel to others</p><p>Authority: knowing when to obey</p><p>We're prewired with the five modules, but each of them can be amplified or toned down by our personality, environment, and experiences</p><p>The outcome is differing moral and political views across and within cultures</p><p>To avoid political or moral 'high-ground' shouting-matches, seek first to understand the opponent's moral foundations</p><p>You'll have a more fruitful conversation and learn a new valuable perspective</p><p><strong>Decline of Violence:</strong> The modern world is witnessing a massive decline in all forms of violence such as war, crime, and interpersonal relationships (see@sapinker's The Better Angels of Our Nature), yet we are accustomed to thinking the modern world is increasingly violent</p><p>This thinking comes from the persistently horrific stories in the news: murders, geopolitical wars, abuse</p><p>It results from the availability bias: the tendency to judge the probability of an event occurring based on how easily it comes to mind</p><p>Since the news disproportionately reports on bad things happening (that's what gets clicks!), we overestimate how common these rare bad events are because they are fresh in our memory</p><p>Antidote: Remember the whole story, not just the available story</p><p><strong>Fox vs. Hedgehogs</strong></p><p>There are two types of people in the world: foxes and hedgehogs</p><p>The dichotomy describes two contrasting ways of viewing the world</p><p>If you adopt foxlike thinking, you rely on various pieces of information to form your view on an issue and think about it from different angles</p><p>If you adopt a hedgehog mindset, your world views and predictions are formed with a central, overarching principle in mind</p><p>Foxes are willing to admit when they're uncertain in the face of difficult problems</p><p>Hedgehogs are more confident in their views, regardless of the uncertainty of the problem at hand</p><p>Unsurprisingly, people with foxlike characteristics tend to make more accurate predictions when it comes to global trends and events</p><p>The best forecasters put their own theories aside, embrace uncertainty, and use multiple perspectives to achieve a more accurate prediction</p><p><strong>Bandwagon Effect:</strong> Ideas, fads, and beliefs grow as more people adopt them</p><p>This concept has heavy overlap with Social Proof and the Technology Adoption Lifecyle</p><p>A lot of modern marketing techniques can be explained through these concepts</p><p><strong>Groupthink:</strong> Due to a desire to 'fit-in' and to retain harmony in group settings, we make irrational decisions, often to minimise conflict</p><p>Solutions? Six thinking hats, write storming, and any other process that forces more objective group decision-making</p><p><strong>Halo Effect:</strong> The tendency to assume other agreeable characteristics upon seeing one agreeable characteristic in someone or something</p><p>" He could never have done that; he's too nice!”</p><p><strong>Moral Luck:</strong> Where someone is assigned blame or praise for an action or its consequences even if it's clear that the person didn't have full control over the action or its consequences</p><p>Assess voluntary actions, not uncontrollable outcomes</p><p><strong>False consensus:</strong> The tendency to believe that your views and behaviours are more common and appropriate to existing circumstances than they are</p><p>"What, you don't drink alcohol?!”</p><p><strong>Curse of knowledge:</strong> Once we know something, we assume everyone else knows it, too</p><p>It's why some experts can't explain their field in simple terms</p><p>and people don't share knowledge that could benefit others; there are always people to teach and people to learn from</p><p><strong>Spotlight effect:</strong> We overestimate how much people are paying attention to our behaviour and appearance</p><p>Hard truth that will pull the weight off your shoulders: People care far more about themselves than they care about you</p><p>Simple but hard antidote: Just be you</p><p><strong>Defensive Attribution:</strong> When someone attributes blame for a mishap to minimize their fear of being a victim or a cause in a similar situation</p><p>Attributing blame allows the person to believe that the mishap was controllable and thus preventable</p><p>Example: you want to feel better or less scared after a car crash happens in front of you</p><p>You blame one of the drivers for being on their phone and tell yourself it couldn't have happened otherwise</p><p>Interestingly, the willingness of the attributor to apportion blame to the person(s) involved has been found to decrease with the perceived similarities between the two parties</p><p>I.e., there is an "In-group bias" that occurs</p><p><strong>Just-World Hypothesis:</strong> We tend to believe the world is a just place; therefore, we assume acts of injustice are deserved and vice-versa</p><p>This is not always the case: good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people</p><p>However, it's refreshing and powerful to think that good equals good</p><p>Without this hypothesis, the motivation to do good would dissolve</p><h1>That's it, thanks for reading!</h1><p>If you got value out of this, I'd appreciate you <a href=https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nZXRyZXZ1ZS5jby9wcm9maWxlL2FsZXhicm9nYW4iLCJwb3N0X2lkIjoiNmI5NmIyMDEtZjA4Zi00NGM5LTk4NDMtMDMzOGFlZGQ0ODJhIiwicHVibGljYXRpb25faWQiOiIxMzdkNWU4My05NTAzLTRkYjctYThjNC1mMzQxNWMyMDU1YWUiLCJ2aXNpdF90b2tlbiI6IjEyMDRlY2U3LTk4OGYtNGFjZC1iNzgwLTAzNmMxY2VlMTA2YiIsImlhdCI6MTY3ODc0NzYxMC41NzcsImlzcyI6Im9yY2hpZCJ9.tLTCu33WX_8KtriG3HY6VDJ3p1TY7wrJlGRbGd07kq4 target=_blank>sharing it</a> or my <a href=https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3R3aXR0ZXIuY29tL19hbGV4YnJvZ2FuIiwicG9zdF9pZCI6IjZiOTZiMjAxLWYwOGYtNDRjOS05ODQzLTAzMzhhZWRkNDgyYSIsInB1YmxpY2F0aW9uX2lkIjoiMTM3ZDVlODMtOTUwMy00ZGI3LWE4YzQtZjM0MTVjMjA1NWFlIiwidmlzaXRfdG9rZW4iOiIxMjA0ZWNlNy05ODhmLTRhY2QtYjc4MC0wMzZjMWNlZTEwNmIiLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzg3NDc2MTAuNTc3LCJpc3MiOiJvcmNoaWQifQ.1kmNYC1MhXzpw9OoY0hoNTyK4T3pr8Ny5JNuKpnpOvE target=_blank>Twitter profile</a> on Twitter so others can get wiser too :)</p><p>Please send me a reply if you have feedback on either of the following questions:</p><ul><li>Was the level of explanation sufficient to understand the concept?</li><li>Would you like to see each week 'themed' by topic, or would you prefer a mix of fields each week?</li></ul><p>‍</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://alexbrogan.com/>Alex Brogan</a></span> ·
