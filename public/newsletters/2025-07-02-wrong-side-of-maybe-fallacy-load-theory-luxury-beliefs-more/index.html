It just gets used differently depending on the demands of your situation‚Äîand maybe not how you want it to be used. When you become fatigued, it‚Äôs harder to place your attention where you want it. h/t @amishijha\nLuxury BeliefsThere‚Äôs increasingly less status attached to luxury goods, so cultural elites signal status with luxury beliefs. These are ideas and opinions that confer status on the rich at very little cost while taking a toll on the lower class. h/t @robkhenderson\nBackwards LawThe more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become, as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place.\nWanting what you have is as good as having what you want. ‚ÄîAlan Watts\nBulverismAssuming someone is wrong because of the person‚Äôs motives, social identity, or personal characteristics. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre only saying that because you‚Äôre a _____.‚Äù\nRemember: Show that someone is wrong before you explain why they‚Äôre wrong.\nNecessity \u0026 SufficiencyA necessity is something you must have to achieve an outcome. Sufficiency is what you actually need to achieve the outcome. Necessary conditions must be present, but on their own, aren‚Äôt enough for achievement.\nThe Toxoplasma of RageThe ideas that spread furthest are the most controversial ideas; not universally agreed upon ideas. We see controversial ideas as an opportunity to signal our commitment to a tribe or stand out from others. h/t¬†@slatestarcodex\nCultural ParasitismWhen an idealogy parasitizes the mind and changes a person's behavior. The person then passes the idealogy onto others, not because it‚Äôs true, but because it‚Äôs easily transmitted and believed.
